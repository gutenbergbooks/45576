<p class="title">THE MOTOR BOYS OVER
THE ROCKIES</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE AIRSHIP STOLEN</small></h2>


<p>“Well, we ought to settle this question about
our vacations, one way or another, fellows,” remarked
a tall, good-looking lad, with something
of an air of worriment, as he glanced at his two
comrades who were stretched out in the shade of
a big maple tree one hot afternoon. He plucked
some blades of grass from the well-kept lawn,
that extended back to a large, white house, with
big pillars, put the spears of green into his mouth,
and chewed them reflectively. Then he added:
“Why can’t you and Chunky agree, Ned? What’s
the use of disputing? It’s too hot.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” answered the smaller of the
two lads thus addressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hot nothing!” puffed the stout youth, whom
the first speaker had called “Chunky” in tribute to
his fleshiness. “It’s only hot because you imagine
it, Ned Slade.”</p>

<p>“Bob says that because he wants to go South,”
retorted Ned. “Eh, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Now don’t you agree with him, Jerry Hopkins!”
cried Bob Baker. “Be on my side for
once,” and he looked an appeal at his tall chum.
“Ned wants to go to Canada.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go to the North Pole to-day,” responded
Ned, turning over, as if to find a cooler
place in the grass. “But, speaking seriously, I
think I’ve got as much right to insist that the
next trip we take in our airship shall be to some
new locality, as Bob has to suggest that we go
South.”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ve got a right to insist,” agreed
Bob, puffing over his exertion of turning on one
side. “Of course you have, Ned. Who started
this argument, anyhow?” and he spoke rather
sharply.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ve got as much right to start an argument
as you have, Bob,” was Ned’s retort, and
there was an unpleasant tone in his voice, at
which Jerry looked troubled.</p>

<p>“Come, fellows,” spoke the tall lad, soothingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
“It’s too warm to bicker. Get down to business.
We’ll take a vote on it. Where shall we
spend this vacation in our airship?”</p>

<p>“I say South!” exclaimed Bob quickly.</p>

<p>“He’s thinking of the Florida everglades,
where the Seabury girls had their houseboat, or
else he wants to try to locate another buried city
in Mexico,” broke in Ned.</p>

<p>“I do; eh? Well, what attracts you to Canada?”
demanded the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s heard that the Seabury girls are
going there,” suggested Jerry, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ned. “I only thought it
would be cooler. I’m willing to leave it to you,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” agreed Bob, more amiably, and the
little cloud that seemed to threaten to come over
the friendship of the chums, had almost vanished.</p>

<p>“I was going to suggest a Western trip,” proposed
Jerry quickly, wishing to strike while the
iron was hot, “but as we have been there before,
perhaps Ned will object.”</p>

<p>“It depends on what part of the West you’d
aim for,” came from Ned. “Go ahead, Jerry,
and tell us some more.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed the tall lad, pleasantly. He
glanced quizzically at his two chums. Bob was idly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
chewing a leaf, and Ned was gazing up into the
blue sky through the leaves of the maple tree.</p>

<p>The three chums, whose devotion to vehicles
of the gasolene type, from motor cycles to airships,
had gained for them the title of “The
Motor Boys,” lived in the town of Cresville, not
far from Boston. Bob Baker’s father was Andrew
Baker, a rich banker; Ned was a son of
Aaron Slade, who was the proprietor of a large
department store, and Jerry Hopkins was the
only child of Mrs. Julia Hopkins, a wealthy
widow.</p>

<p>The boys had had many adventures together,
and the beginning of them was told of in the first
book of this series, entitled “The Motor Boys.”
Their activities started in a bicycle race, but they
soon exchanged their wheels for motor cycles,
and a short time after that they won a touring
car, offered as a prize. In that they made a long
trip overland, and, later, went to Mexico, to
which trip Ned referred when he mentioned the
buried city, for the boys actually did discover
one, for which a friend of theirs, Professor Uriah
Snodgrass, a noted scientist, was in search.</p>

<p>They returned home from Mexico across the
western plains of the United States, and then,
using some money they had made from a gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
mine they had located, they bought a speedy
motor boat.</p>

<p>The fifth volume of this series, entitled “The
Motor Boys Afloat,” took up their adventures in
connection with the speedy craft <i>Dartaway</i>. They
had some stirring times around home, and then
took quite a long trip along the Atlantic coast.
From there they journeyed to the mysterious
Florida everglades, to which Ned had also referred.
But the happenings there, strange and
weird as they were, seemed, to the boys at least,
to be more than equalled in a trip they made on
the Pacific, though this voyage was in a motor
boat they hired, as their own was smashed in a
freight wreck.</p>

<p>The growing interest in aeronautics soon led
the motor boys to investigate the possibility of
navigating through the air, and, shortly after
their return from their trip on the Pacific, they
began to build an airship. In this they were assisted
by a Mr. Rupert Glassford, and in the
ninth book of this series, called “The Motor Boys
in the Clouds,” there was related the particulars
of a trip they took for fame and fortune.</p>

<p>Their airship, a combination of dirigible balloon
and aeroplane, was called the <i>Comet</i>, and
was one of the most completely fitted-up air craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
devised in recent years. There was ample accommodation
for a long trip, and the travelers could
keep afloat in it a long time, provided no accident
occurred. In it, as related in the ninth book,
they won a substantial prize in competition with
a number of balloons and aeroplanes.</p>

<p>It was about this airship that Bob, Ned and
Jerry were talking the pleasant summer afternoon,
on which I have, once more, brought them
to the attention of my readers. As they sat there
on the grass, their minds went back to the wonderful
air trip they had made and they thought
of the efforts of Professor Snodgrass to capture
strange insects and bugs, for that was the one
hobby of the scientist. They also recalled the
dastardly attempt made by Noddy Nixon, a town
bully, to injure them, by firing at their craft.
Noddy had made an attempt to build a sort of
airship, but had failed.</p>

<p>Now the motor boys were on the point of planning
a second flight in their craft, only, as has
been indicated, they could not seem to agree on
where to go. The long summer vacation had arrived,
bringing a cessation of studies, and in the
blood of the three chums there was a desire to be
doing something.</p>

<p>For several seconds after Jerry Hopkins had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
announced his willingness to tell his chums of his
plan, he remained silent; so long, in fact, that
Bob asked:</p>

<p>“Well, what about it, Jerry? Are you, too,
thinking of the Seabury girls?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” was the answer, accompanied
by a short laugh. “I was just considering the
best method of presenting the matter to you fellows,
so you wouldn’t get on your ears again;
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Punch him, Bob!” cried Ned suddenly.
“You’re nearer than I am. The nerve of him!
Insulting us like that!”</p>

<p>Bob playfully raised his fleshy fist with the intention
of thumping Jerry in the side, but the
other, with a quick motion, snapped a pebble from
his thumb, and the little stone struck Bob on the
end of the nose, causing him to wince.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Quit that!” the stout lad cried.</p>

<p>“That was just my way of calling the meeting
to order,” declared Jerry. “I’m ready to proceed,
now. My plan would be to make as long
a trip as possible. It would be something of a
record to fly from here to, say, Kansas or Colorado.”</p>

<p>“Why not to Arizona while you’re about it,”
put in Bob, still rubbing his nose in a reflective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
manner. “Then we could see if Jim Nestor is
giving us our share of the gold from our mine,
though, of course, I only said that last for a joke,”
he added hastily.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t make Arizona on one supply of
gasolene,” objected Ned.</p>

<p>“Who said we could?” fired back Bob. The
spirit of contention was not yet stilled, so Jerry
hastened to add:</p>

<p>“Of course, it wouldn’t be possible to make
anything like as long a trip as that without coming
down, but I calculated on that. We won’t
try for speed, only for distance. The reason I
proposed the West is that this season of the year
is best for going out there: the prevailing winds
are more favorable, and I think we would enjoy
it immensely. Of course it is nice down South,
and, as for Canada, I have heard that it is fine
there in the summer, but if you left it for me
to decide, I’d say let’s take the <i>Comet</i> and go
West.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Bob, whose usual good
spirits had returned. “I’m willing. West it shall
be,” and he looked inquiringly at Ned, who was
not the one to hold out against his two chums.</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” he announced. “We’ll get the
<i>Comet</i> ready for a long Western trip&mdash;across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Rocky Mountains if necessary. We’ll have a
fine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ned’s remarks were suddenly interrupted by
the arrival of a small lad who rushed across the
lawn toward where the three chums were sitting
under the tree. The newcomer was much excited.
His hat had fallen off, one cuff was all
awry, and his hair was tousled, while his cheeks
were flushed.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;say!” he cried, brokenly, not pausing in
his rush. “I&mdash;just&mdash;came past&mdash;the shed&mdash;where
you&mdash;keep your airship. It’s terrible&mdash;door
broken open&mdash;lock smashed&mdash;things scattered all
about&mdash;watchman not there&mdash;airship gone!” The
little lad had to pause for breath.</p>

<p>“The airship gone!” exclaimed Jerry, leaping
to his feet, an example followed by Ned and Bob.
“What do you mean, Andy Rush? Is this a
joke?”</p>

<p>“No joke at all&mdash;airship’s gone&mdash;I saw the vacant
shed,” and Andy Rush sank down on the
grass, completely exhausted by his run, and his
rapid talk, which latter was characteristic of
him, by nature as well as by name.</p>

<p>“Did you see it go?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see it go&mdash;but it was gone when
I came past,” answered the excitable little chap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who took it?” demanded Bob, clenching his
fists, as if he wanted to attack some one.</p>

<p>“Don’t know!” gasped Andy. “But&mdash;it’s gone.
First&mdash;I thought&mdash;you fellows&mdash;had it out, but
when&mdash;I came up here&mdash;and saw you sitting down&mdash;I
knew it&mdash;wasn’t you. But it’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows!” commanded Jerry quickly.
“Let’s see what’s up.”</p>

<p>Followed by Andy they hurried off toward the
shed where the <i>Comet</i> was kept. This structure
was some distance away from Jerry’s house. It
had been specially built to house the airship, and
was located in the midst of a large field, owned
by Mrs. Hopkins, which field gave ample room
for manœuvring the craft. It was some distance
from a road, and in an unfrequented locality.</p>

<p>It did not take long to arrive at the place.
Before they reached the shed they could see that
the big doors were opened. So far Andy’s tale
had been confirmed. A few minutes later the
motor boys were staring into the empty shed. The
big air craft was gone!</p>

<p>“It’s been stolen, boys!” exclaimed Jerry, as he
stepped into the shed. “Our airship has been
stolen!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll wager Noddy Nixon had a hand in
it!” added Bob. “Let’s get right after him!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>AN UNCONSCIOUS WATCHMAN</small></h2>


<p>After the first moment of hesitation, the boys,
including Andy Rush, stepped within the big shed.
It was as if they hoped to see the <i>Comet</i> concealed
somewhere in the place, but the expanse of the
airship planes, and the immense, bulging, gas bag
did not greet their eyes.</p>

<p>“How long ago did you come past here, Andy?”
asked Jerry, recovering some of his usual calmness.</p>

<p>“Not ten minutes ago,” replied the little chap.
“I was on my way to town, and I thought I’d
take this short cut. As soon as I came within
sight of the shed, I saw the open doors.”</p>

<p>“And what did you do?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Looked in, to see if you were going off on a
trip,” replied Andy. “I thought maybe you’d give
me a ride. Then, when I saw the airship gone,
and noticed that the doors were broken open, I
knew something must have happened. I hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
off to find you&mdash;saw you sitting on the grass as
if nothing had happened&mdash;great excitement&mdash;airship
stolen&mdash;robbers in it&mdash;Noddy Nixon, maybe&mdash;airship
wrecked&mdash;maybe&mdash;whoop!” and Andy
ended up with a gasp, so rapid had been his utterance.</p>

<p>“Now just calm yourself,” begged Jerry. “Tell
us all you can, Andy.”</p>

<p>“That’s all I know,” replied the small, excitable
chap.</p>

<p>“The bars on the doors are broken,” called
Bob, as he made an examination. “How do you
s’pose that happened?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Jerry, who had overlooked
this part of Andy’s account. “And I
wonder where Sud Snuffles is? He ought to be
around. He’s paid enough to watch this place.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; where is Sud?” inquired Ned.
“Maybe he went off in the airship with the
thieves.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” exclaimed Jerry. “Let’s look
around.”</p>

<p>The boys proceeded to make an examination
of the interior of the shed. As Andy had related,
it was in some confusion. Tools of various
kinds were scattered about, and several
boxes and chests had been broken open, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
contents, consisting of supplies for the craft,
some canned food stuffs and spare parts, had
been taken out. A big hammer near the front
doors showed how the latter had been broken
open.</p>

<p>“Those doors were smashed from inside!”
cried Ned, after a more careful scrutiny.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because the hammer’s thrown down inside,
and the way the bolts are bent shows that the
force was from within.”</p>

<p>“From within, eh?” murmured Jerry. “That’s
interesting.”</p>

<p>“What does it indicate?” inquired Bob, who
was not always so quick to see a point as were
his two chums.</p>

<p>“Why it shows that the robbers, whoever they
were, got into this shed from some other entrance
than the big doors,” went on Jerry.</p>

<p>“Of course!” cried Ned. “The small door at
the back! Why didn’t we think of it before?
That’s the way Sud Snuffles goes in and out nights.
I remember he said it was too much trouble to
open the big double doors, and Sud was never
very fond of work.”</p>

<p>“Come on; we must look for Sud, and see if
the side door has been forced,” decided Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>As they hurried through the big shed, to a small
portal in the rear, Andy Rush remarked:</p>

<p>“I wonder how the thieves dare take the airship
in broad daylight? Everyone around here knows
it belongs to you fellows, and if Noddy Nixon or
anyone else was seen in it, the police would be
notified. It was a risky thing to do!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it wasn’t done in daylight,” suggested
Jerry. “I was down here last evening, before
dusk, and everything was all right, and Sud was
on guard. He always stays all night. It may
be that the ship was stolen last night, and Andy
was the first one to notice it this morning.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” agreed Ned. “But now
to find Sud, and see what explanation he has to
make. If he has deserted his place, and gone off,
we’ll discharge him.”</p>

<p>By this time the lads were at the small door.
Near it was a chair and a cot, on which the watchman
was in the habit of sitting or lying during
the night. Sud Snuffles had been hired by the
motor boys shortly after their return from their
first long trip, for as the airship was in a shed,
some distance away from the nearest house, they
feared some mischievous persons might try to
damage it. But, up to the present, there had been
no trouble. Sud was an odd character, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
shiftless, and not much given to holding a steady
position. He was very fond of traveling, and
the night job just suited him, because he could
roam about in the daytime, when there was no
necessity for being on guard. He seemed to have
a faculty of getting into all sorts of trouble, and
slipping out again with ease.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything of Sud,” remarked Jerry,
peering about.</p>

<p>“Then he’s gone with the thieves!” decided
Andy. “He’s in a conspiracy with them! Helped
steal the airship&mdash;gone off on a trip&mdash;he’s fond
of traveling&mdash;he’d go ten thousand miles&mdash;never
come back&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>“Andy, <em>will</em> you be quiet,” begged Jerry. “This
may be a serious matter. Look around and see
if you can find any traces of Sud, boys.”</p>

<p>“He seems to have slept in the cot,” observed
Bob. “The clothes are all mussed up.”</p>

<p>They began a hasty search of the rear of the
shop, Andy joining in. But though they looked
in several closets where tools or supplies were
kept, and peered into all sorts of odd nooks and
corners, there was no sign of the watchman.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he has gone off,” began Jerry, but,
the next moment, he and the others were startled
by hearing a groan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s killed!” gasped Andy, his face
turning pale.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“It sounded from under the cot,” observed
Ned.</p>

<p>His words were a signal for all to rush to the
little bed. Jerry lifted up the clothes that draped
over the front edge, concealing a view underneath.
As the lad raised the coverlets, there was disclosed
a pitiful sight.</p>

<p>Old Sud Snuffles, tied with numerous ropes, his
head enveloped in a bag, lay under the cot. He
was as helpless as a baby, and, as the boys looked
at him in wonder and alarm, a stifled groan came
from the bag. At the same time Jerry sniffed the
air suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Boys!” he cried, “Sud has been drugged&mdash;chloroformed!
We must bring him to consciousness,
and then, maybe, he can tell us about the
theft of our airship. There’s been some queer
goings-on here!”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>ON A MYSTERIOUS TRAIL</small></h2>


<p>It was the work of only a few seconds for the
active lads to get poor Sud from under the cot,
and cut the ropes that bound him. Then the bag
was taken from his head, and it was discovered
that he was gagged. The smell of chloroform was
more strong and Jerry, applying to his nose the
rag that had served to stifle the voice of the
watchman, detected on it the odor of the drug.</p>

<p>“This is desperate business,” remarked Ned
soberly.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” asserted Jerry. “If Noddy
Nixon has had a hand in this I’ll prosecute him
for it. He’s going too far. This is the worst of
his many tricks.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Sud will die?” inquired Andy,
hovering about anxiously, moving here and there,
like a restless bird. “Is he dead now? I can’t
hear him breathe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be all right as soon as we get him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
into the fresh air,” declared Jerry. “Bob, bring
me the aromatic ammonia. I’ll give him a few
drops, and then we’ll carry him outside.”</p>

<p>The boys, from long experience in traveling and
camping, knew something about simple remedies,
and soon a restorative was being forced through
Sud’s lips. Then he was carried outside the shed,
and his collar loosened. In a few minutes he
opened his eyes, and stared wonderingly about
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;don’t hit me again!” he implored. “I
ain’t never done nothin’ to you, Mr. Nixon&mdash;but
I can’t let you take the airship without&mdash;&mdash;” then
the unfortunate man stopped, as he saw friendly
faces about him.</p>

<p>“Was I&mdash;did I dream it?” he asked, passing
his hand over his head. “Is the airship all right?
Was Noddy Nixon here? Did he hit me?” and
he felt of the back of his head.</p>

<p>“The airship is gone,” replied Jerry. “What
happened, Sud? Were you attacked? Was Noddy
Nixon here in the night?”</p>

<p>“He was, or else I dreamed it,” declared the
watchman. “He struck me, too, and then I don’t
remember what happened, except I smelled something
funny. Then it got dark, and I heard noises&mdash;but
you say the airship’s gone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Completely,” broke in Bob.</p>

<p>“Then we must get right after Noddy Nixon,
and the old man, and Jack Pender, who were
with him!” declared Sud excitedly, trying to rise,
but falling weakly back.</p>

<p>“Easy now, take it easy,” advised Jerry soothingly.
“We’ll get after him, all right. But you
must first tell us what happened. Do you feel
strong enough?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m all right now,” replied the watchman.
“I’m getting better every minute. I’ll tell
you as much as I know.”</p>

<p>“Take a little of this medicine and you’ll feel
stronger,” advised Jerry, holding a glass to the
man’s lips. When Sud had partaken of it, he resumed:</p>

<p>“It must have been about eleven o’clock last
night, when I was just getting ready to turn in,
that I heard some persons coming to the shed.
By the way they walked I knew there was more
than one, and I was wondering if you boys had
decided to make a night trip, without speaking to
me about it. Well, I went to the door, when
there came a knock on it&mdash;the small back door,
you know,” he said, and the boys nodded comprehendingly.
“You can imagine my surprise when I
saw Noddy Nixon, and two persons with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Noddy walked right in, as if he owned the place,
and told the others to come in, too.”</p>

<p>“Who were they?” interrupted Jerry.</p>

<p>“One was Jack Pender,” replied the watchman,
and Jerry nodded his head. Well he knew Pender,
an unscrupulous crony of Noddy’s, who had,
more than once, made trouble for the motor boys.</p>

<p>“And who was the other?” Ned wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“He was a stranger,” said Sud. “An old man,
with a long white beard, and a peculiar scar on
his jaw.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a mark?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“It was shaped like the letter L as near as I
could make out.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Jerry. “Like the letter
L, you say? And an old man, with a white beard?
Yet it’s hardly possible that it can be he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who?” inquired Bob excitedly.</p>

<p>“The old hermit of Lost Lake,” answered Jerry
musingly. “You know, fellows, he had just such
a scar; but what would he be doing here, especially
in company with Noddy Nixon? No, it
can’t be!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what sort of a man you’re speaking
of,” went on Sud, “but this man seemed to
know you. He spoke of Bob and Ned, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
he now owed so much to you that he could never
repay it. He added that if he could use the airship
to rescue the people from the deep valley he
would be more than ever in your debt.”</p>

<p>“Rescue people from the valley? Be in our
debt? And he spoke as if he knew us?” fired
Jerry at the watchman. “Then it must have been
the old hermit, Jackson Bell, whom we rescued&mdash;and
whose son, Bobby, we saved from the gang
of Mexicans. But I can’t understand it&mdash;it seems
incredible&mdash;how came he here&mdash;how did he come
to mention all this?” and Jerry looked with a
puzzled air at Sud Snuffles, who was rapidly recovering.</p>

<p>“He didn’t mention it all at once,” said the
watchman. “The old hermit, if that’s what you
call him, let out by degrees what I have told you.
So his name was Jackson Bell, eh? Well, Noddy
didn’t call him anything.”</p>

<p>“Probably he did not want you to remember
the name,” suggested Bob. “But I’m sure it’s the
same man.” The description of the rescue of the
hermit will be found in the book “The Motor
Boys Across the Plains; or the Hermit of Lost
Lake.”</p>

<p>“What else did you hear, and what happened?”
inquired Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I was naturally surprised to see Noddy
and the two persons with him,” resumed the
watchman, “and more so when Noddy gave me a
note, and said Jerry Hopkins had written it, and
that it was permission for him to take out the airship.”</p>

<p>“A note from me?” cried Jerry. “Let’s see it!”</p>

<p>Sud Snuffles fumbled in his pocket, and brought
out a crumpled paper, which he extended to Jerry,
who eagerly scanned it.</p>

<p>“A rank forgery,” he pronounced it, “yet good
enough to fool you, Sud, especially at night.”</p>

<p>“What does the note say?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“It reads: ‘Permission is hereby given Noddy
Nixon and his friends to take out the <i>Comet</i>,’ and
it’s signed with my name,” replied Jerry. “But
go on, Sud. What happened next?”</p>

<p>“Well, when I saw the note I thought everything
was all right, though it looked queer. Still
it wasn’t up to me to say anything. Then Noddy
went around as if he owned the place, and he
began explaining to the old man with the white
beard how the airship worked. He said that in
it he could rescue the friends of the old man
without any trouble.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what that rescue means?” mused
Jerry. “Can some of Mr. Bell’s friends be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
prisoners; and has he come to us for help, only
to be roped in by Noddy Nixon?”</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“There’s some mystery here,” asserted Ned,
“and it’s up to us to solve it.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll do it!” exclaimed Jerry. “Go on,
Sud, tell us all you can. This is getting deeper
and deeper.”</p>

<p>“There was some talk between Jerry and the
old hermit, as you call him,” resumed the watchman.
“The hermit said he would pay well for
the use of the airship, and Noddy seemed to know
all about running it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, though he hasn’t had much experience,
he can run an airship all right,” admitted Ned.
“He’s watched us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” went on Sud Snuffles, “they talked of
going out West, and as I knew you boys had
planned to go on your vacation in the <i>Comet</i> I
wondered at your giving permission for that. It
was this talk that made me suspicious, and I hung
around where Noddy was talking to Mr. Bell, as
you say his name was. That seemed to make
Noddy mad, and he told me to go to bed. I
wouldn’t do it, and, when the elderly man was
away up in the front part of the airship cabin&mdash;for
he inspected every part of it&mdash;Noddy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Jack Pender came close to me. Before I knew
what was happening they both sprang at me, and
knocked me down. I tried to yell and I fought as
well as I could, but they were too much for me.
The last I remember is feeling them tie something
over my mouth, then I smelled something queer,
and I seemed to go to sleep. The next thing I
knew after hearing confused sounds, as if something
was being smashed, was when you awakened
me.”</p>

<p>“The smashing you heard was them battering
away at the big bolts on the front door,” was
Bob’s opinion, and his chums nodded. The portal
fastened with bars and bolts instead of a lock and
key.</p>

<p>“Well, I, for one, can’t understand all of it,”
said Andy. “Whoop! But things must have happened,
though.”</p>

<p>“Several things very evidently happened,” remarked
Jerry dryly, “and rather mysterious happenings
they were, too,” and then the leader of
the motor boys explained his view of the matter.
It was his opinion that Mr. Jackson Bell, at
one time a hermit, but whom the boys had not seen
in some time, had come East with a view of providing
for the rescue of some persons (his friends,
probably) from some strange valley. Unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
he had met with Noddy Nixon, so Jerry believed,
and Noddy had seized the opportunity to
make some money out of Mr. Bell, deceiving him
as to the ownership of the airship.</p>

<p>Jerry explained how he believed that Noddy
had forged the note he took to Sud Snuffles, accompanied
by Jack Pender, and the former hermit.</p>

<p>“Everything went well, I think,” went on Jerry,
“until after Noddy had handed over the forged
note, and prepared to take away our airship. Then
he became fearful that it would be evidence against
him, and he and Jack attacked Sud, to take the
note away. They rendered the watchman unconscious,
smashed open the big doors, and floated
out in the <i>Comet</i>, for Noddy has seen us operate
it often enough to understand the mechanism.
Now the question is, to decide where they have
gone. Very likely Noddy set off in quest of the
mysterious valley, that Mr. Bell knows about.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’m glad I managed to keep the
forged note,” observed Sud Snuffles.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be a sort of clew,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder Mr. Bell didn’t get suspicious
and leave when Noddy and Jack were struggling
with Sud,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“He probably didn’t hear the fight,” was Jerry’s
opinion. “Mr. Bell (if it really was he) was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
very likely, in the cabin of our airship, and the
fight, as Sud says, took place at the rear of the
shed. Besides, probably Mr. Bell was thinking
so deeply over the prospective rescue of his friends
from danger, that he paid little attention to anything
else.”</p>

<p>“What danger do you suppose his friends are
in, Jerry?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Haven’t the least idea. It must be something
desperate, though, to induce him to seek an airship
with which to rescue them. It’s a mystery&mdash;a
mystery of the air, and we’ve got to solve it.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we can’t?” asked Ned. “Maybe we’ll
never see the <i>Comet</i> again. Noddy Nixon may
smash it all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Don’t suggest such a thing!” begged Jerry
earnestly. “We’ll get right after Noddy, and
we’ll try to get at the bottom of the mystery. If
Mr. Bell, or his friends, are in trouble we will
help them, and, if necessary, in the <i>Comet</i>, for
we’ll get it away from Noddy and Jack. Then
we’ll see what will happen.”</p>

<p>“But how are we going to chase after Noddy?”
asked Bob. “We haven’t anything that can go
as fast as the <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>“Not quite as swiftly, but nearly,” answered
Jerry with a smile. “Our automobile! We’ll get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that out, and get right on the trail of this mystery!
Come on, fellows! We’ve lost enough time as it
is! Now for the chase!” and Jerry started back
toward his house, followed by his chums and Sud
Snuffles.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>A FARMER’S CLEW</small></h2>


<p>The boys, with Sud, were soon at Jerry’s
house. Mrs. Hopkins, looking from the window
of her sitting room, saw their excited manners,
and, fearing that something had happened, hurried
down stairs.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry?” she cried. “Is
anyone hurt?”</p>

<p>“Only me, Mrs. Hopkins,” replied Sud, who
was not a little proud to be thus the centre of
attraction. “And I’m not hurt so very much,”
he added. “It’s my feelings more than anything.
The idea of me letting Noddy Nixon and Jack
Pender tie me up the way they did.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t help it,” commented Bob, while
Jerry soon related to his mother what had occurred,
and told of their plan to set off in search
of the missing airship.</p>

<p>“Now, please be careful, boys,” the widow
begged. “That Noddy Nixon is getting to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
desperate character. He may do you some injury.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see him!” cried Ned. “If we get
within sight of him and Jack they’ll jump overboard
out of the <i>Comet</i> without waiting for us.
But I think, Jerry, that we ought to have him
and Jack arrested for stealing our airship. Let’s
swear out a warrant for those two chaps, and
then we can ask the aid of the police in locating
them.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d do,” put in Sud, who was
rubbing his head, where there was a lump, caused
by the tussle with the two bullies. “Have ’em
arrested, and I’ll make a charge of something or
other against ’em.” Bob also thought it would
be a good plan to take formal action.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see what your fathers say,” remarked
Jerry, who had none of his own to consult.
“We’ll go over and see Mr. Slade and
Mr. Baker,” he added, turning to his mother,
“and be guided by them. In the meanwhile, Sud,
get out the automobile, will you, and see that
it’s in shape for a long trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going away again, Jerry?” asked
Mrs. Hopkins, in some distress. “I was in hopes
that you would remain at home a few weeks this
vacation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“We were just planning our vacation in the
airship, when Andy Rush brought word that it
had been stolen,” replied Ned. “I guess now
we’ll have to stay home, or else go on a trip in
the auto.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, I discovered that the <i>Comet</i> was
gone!” exclaimed the excitable Andy. “Doors
busted open&mdash;Sud unconscious&mdash;everything upside
down&mdash;great excitement&mdash;tell the police&mdash;get
a gun and shoot at Noddy&mdash;whoop!” and the
little chap had to stand on his tiptoes to get out the
last few words.</p>

<p>“There, there now, Andy,” spoke Jerry, soothingly.
“Come on, fellows, we’ll take some advice
on this. Get at the auto, Sud, that is, if you
feel able.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right now,” answered the watchman,
as he started toward the garage, which had
recently been built at the side of Jerry’s house.</p>

<p>In turn Mr. Slade and Mr. Baker were informed
of the theft of the airship, and asked as
to the necessity of swearing out a warrant against
Noddy and Jack. Both gentlemen were opposed
to it, and Mr. Baker said:</p>

<p>“If you do get the warrants, and arrest those
lads, you will also be obliged to arrest Mr. Bell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the hermit, as you call him. He was with the
lads when they took the airship, you think, and,
in the eyes of the law, is just as guilty. You
don’t want to have him taken into custody, do
you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” replied Jerry. “Mr. Bell is a
good friend of ours, and, though we can’t just
understand what he is doing with Noddy and
Jack, nor about the mysterious rescue of his
friends, we know he has been deceived by those
two chaps. No, we’d better not get any warrants.
We’ll hunt for ’em on our own account, and settle
with ’em when we find ’em. Come on, boys, back
to my house, and then for an auto trip!”</p>

<p>“I wish I could come,” said Andy wistfully.
Jerry looked at Bob and Ned. Both nodded in
a friendly manner.</p>

<p>“All right, Andy, come along,” answered the
widow’s son. “You did us a great service in
letting us know, so soon, that the airship was
stolen, and you’re entitled to some reward. Only
there is one favor I’m going to ask of you.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Andy quickly.</p>

<p>“When we sight Noddy in the airship, just
keep cool,” went on the tall lad. “If you get
excited and talk as much hot air as you usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
do, you may explode the gas in the balloon, and
then it will be worse than having the <i>Comet</i>
stolen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep quiet,” promised Andy very earnestly.
“I’ll not say a word.”</p>

<p>The four lads were soon back at Jerry’s house,
and found Sud busy tinkering with the auto, for
he knew something about cars. The gasolene
tank was full, and he was putting water in the
radiator.</p>

<p>The car was now ready to start, and the boys
climbed in. Ned and Bob had notified their folks
that they might be gone all day, and probably
part of the night, and Andy Rush had, by telephoning
home, secured permission to accompany
them.</p>

<p>Jerry went into the house to bid his mother
good-bye, and, as he came out, Bob stood up in
the tonneau of the car, where he had taken his
place with Andy.</p>

<p>“I say, Jerry,” began the stout lad, eagerly,
“what about grub? It will soon be dinner time,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, good land! I might have known that was
coming!” and Ned fairly groaned. “There you
go again, Chunky!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess it will soon be dinner time,
won’t it?” and the lad, who had gained a reputation
in the way of always being hungry, appealed
to Jerry.</p>

<p>“It will, if time continues to fly as it has this
morning, Bob,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Of course, and we’ll have to eat. Hadn’t you
better take along a lunch? Or, if your cook is
too busy to put up one, drive around to our place,
and I’ll get a few sandwiches.”</p>

<p>“They keep ’em in barrels at Bob’s house,” explained
Ned to Mrs. Hopkins, who was a smiling
observer of the scene. “All Bob has to do
is to push a button for whatever kind of sandwich
he wants between meals. They know his
failing. I dare say the cook is at this moment
buttering bread, and cutting meat in anticipation
of hearing Chunky’s despairing cry of ‘I’m hungry,’
at almost any minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dry up!” commanded Bob, indignantly.
“You’d think I was the only one in this
crowd who ever ate anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, if you think you’ll not be home
before lunch,” began Mrs. Hopkins, “perhaps you
had better&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, mother, thank you,” interrupted Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
anticipating what she was going to say. “We’ll
stop and buy our dinner on the way. We have
delayed too long as it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, as long as we’re going to eat sometime,
that’s all I want,” commented Bob, with a
sigh of relief, as he took his seat again. Jerry
climbed up, and assumed charge of the steering
wheel, while Ned cranked up, and with a series
of “chugs-chugs” the auto started off, the boys
waving a farewell to Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“It seems like old times to be traveling this
way, doesn’t it?” asked Ned, of Jerry, as they
went swinging along the country road. “Maybe
we’ll have to take our vacation in this, after all.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be so bad,” was his chum’s opinion,
as he suddenly steered to one side, to avoid
running over an angry dog, who seemed to object
to the progress of the car.</p>

<p>“That’s so, we were talking about where we
would spend our vacation, when Andy came along
with his news,” put in Bob, from the tonneau.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t start that dispute again,” begged
Jerry. “We are going to have a rather strenuous
time, if I’m any judge, before we get through
with this search.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t going to start any dispute,” remarked
Bob quickly. “I was going to say that I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
leave it all to you, where we’ll go this summer.
I don’t care, as long as we get the <i>Comet</i> back.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” added Ned. “I’ll leave it to
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you say that we fulfill the agreement,
which Noddy seems falsely to have made
with our hermit?” asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“You mean to go to the rescue of his friends?”
inquired Ned, with a queer look at his chum’s face.</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean,” went on Jerry, quietly.
“Wherever or whoever they are, let’s go to their
rescue in the <i>Comet</i>. They must be in some peculiar
situation or an airship would never be needed
to save them. We’ll take Noddy’s place, and
help our old friend, Jackson Bell.”</p>

<p>Jerry then went into details about his plan of
pursuit. He proposed that they proceed in their
auto, along the main, or state road, in a westerly
direction, for Jerry believed that would be
Noddy’s destination. It was Jerry’s belief that
Noddy would not dare to run the airship at full
speed, which would make it possible to overtake
him in the auto.</p>

<p>“We’ll probably be gone on our quest several
days,” went on the leader of the lads, and when
Andy Rush heard this he expressed a fear that
his parents would not like him to be away over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
night. It was then agreed that, in case Noddy
was not overtaken that day, to send Andy back
home by train.</p>

<p>A little later the search was under way, and,
as the speedy machine swayed along over the hard
road, the boys scanned the sky for any speck,
large or small, which might proclaim the presence
of the <i>Comet</i>. From time to time they stopped, to
make inquiries from other autoists or persons
driving, as to whether or not an airship had been
sighted that morning.</p>

<p>Some of their questions were met with puzzled
looks, as if the persons thought they were being
made the butt of a joke. Others were interested
enough, and made all sorts of inquiries, as to why
the boys were searching, but they had seen nothing
of the craft of the air.</p>

<p>The lads made a stop for dinner at a country
hotel, and when Bob heard that there was to be
chicken pot-pie his broad face was wreathed in
smiles.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we didn’t bring any lunch along,” he
remarked, “because we couldn’t have taken anything
more than sandwiches. But chicken pot-pie&mdash;Ah,
um!” and he sniffed the air suggestively.</p>

<p>They were under way again that afternoon, but
as they proceeded mile after mile, and saw no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
signs of the airship, and heard nothing from the
many inquiries they made, they all began to get a
bit discouraged. It was about four o’clock, when
Andy Rush, who had stared up into the sky so
steadily that his neck was getting stiff, uttered an
exclamation:</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried the little chap. “Stop the
auto&mdash;get a gun&mdash;shoot him&mdash;make him stop&mdash;we’ve
got him!” and he stood up and pointed at
a black speck in the sky. Clearly it was not a
bird, for it was moving too slowly, and it looked
as if it might be some sort of an airship. Jerry
jammed on the brakes, after shutting off the
power, and took up a pair of powerful field
glasses. These he trained on the speck, while his
companions waited anxiously:</p>

<p>“It’s only a box kite,” said Jerry at last. “It’s
pretty high up, though. Too bad, Andy.”</p>

<p>They went on again, and as the afternoon
passed they began to give up hope, and talked of
where they would spend the night, for they were
determined not to go back home without some
news of their airship. They had come prepared
for a night’s stay at a hotel, and, not many miles
from where they now were, was a railroad station,
where Andy could get a train home.</p>

<p>As they were chug-chugging along a quiet road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Jerry saw, just ahead of him, a farmer driving
toward them a spirited team of horses.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll slow up a bit when passing them,”
the tall lad remarked to his chums. “I don’t want
a runaway.”</p>

<p>The team seemed so skittish as they approached
that, for fear of frightening them, Jerry shut off
all power, and the auto came to a stop.</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you,” called the farmer,
as he held in the animals when passing the car.
“It ain’t often that automobile fellers is as considerate
as you be. I appreciate it. Besides, my
team hasn’t gotten over a fright they had early
this morning.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” asked Ned, while the farmer
pulled up, the two fine horses evincing less fear
of the auto, now that it was quiet. “Did a car
scare them this morning?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly an automobile,” was the
answer, “that is, unless autos run overhead in the
air.”</p>

<p>Jerry caught at that remark at once:</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Why just this,” was the unexpected answer.
“When I was going to market, about three o’clock
this morning, my horses nearly ran away when
something about as big as ten automobiles scooted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
along through the air, over their heads. It was
some sort of a balloon.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was a balloon?” inquired
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, some sort of a balloon,” replied the
farmer. “You see, there was some moonlight,
but I couldn’t make it out very well. It was an
airship, I know, because I’ve seen pictures of ’em.
It was shaped like a cigar, about a hundred feet
long, or more, I guess, and sticking out from
the sides, were big white wings. By Golly; but it
scared me at first!”</p>

<p>“That’s our airship!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Your airship?” inquired the farmer, visibly
astonished.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are in search of one stolen from us
in Cresville,” said Jerry. “The one you saw may
have been it. Which way was it going?”</p>

<p>“It come from that direction,” replied the man,
pointing back toward Cresville, “and it was headed
almost west, along this road you’re on now.
First I knowed I heard a humming, buzzing
sound, and I took a tight hold on the reins, as I
thought an auto was coming. Then when I looked
around, for the noise was in back of me, I seen a
big light in the air. I thought it must be an all-fired
big auto, that had a light so high up, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
next I knew the blamed thing was right over my
head, and not more than fifty feet up. Then I
knowed it was an airship, but I come near knowing
nothing else right after, for my horses started to
run, and I had all I could do to hold ’em. Well,
the airship, or whatever it was, swooped on out
of sight in the darkness, and I didn’t get my animals
down to a walk for nearly a mile.”</p>

<p>“And it was going this way?” asked Ned, pointing
in the same direction as that in which the auto
was headed.</p>

<p>“It was,” answered the farmer. “But I don’t
believe you’ll catch it. Them airship fellers don’t
leave any trail behind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll catch him!” cried Jerry, determinedly.
“We’re much obliged to you for this clew.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re welcome, I’m sure. Whenever
anyone does me a good turn, I like to return the
compliment. I hope you catch them,” and the
farmer was about to drive on. “But what makes
you think that was your shebang?” he asked.</p>

<p>“From the peculiar shape of it,” answered
Jerry. “Ours is a combined dirigible balloon and
aeroplane, and that’s what you saw. Besides, it
came from the right direction. Come on, fellows,”
he added. “We’re on the trail at last.
Now to catch Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE TELEGRAM</small></h2>


<p>But if the motor boys thought they would soon
catch up to those who had stolen the <i>Comet</i> they
were doomed to disappointment. For the rest of
the day they drove the auto at top speed, but there
was no sign of the missing airship, nor could they
get any news of it.</p>

<p>“We might as well put up for the night,” was
Jerry’s opinion, as it began to get dark. “We
may pass it in the night, if we don’t. Andy, we’ll
take you to the station, and send you home. I’ll
telegraph your folks that you are coming, so they
won’t be worried.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could come with you,” spoke the little
chap.</p>

<p>But they knew it would be best for him to return,
and after promising him a ride in the <i>Comet</i>,
when they should have recovered it, they bade
farewell to the excitable lad at the station. They
put up at a hotel in the town of Rodmead, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was about a hundred miles from Cresville, the
auto having made good time on her searching
trip. After supper the lads talked over their
plans.</p>

<p>“It’s certain that we’re going in the right direction,”
remarked Jerry, “but when we’ll catch up
to Noddy is another matter. I’m afraid it will
take some time.”</p>

<p>“If we could only send word on ahead, and
have him stopped,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s a good plan!” exclaimed the elder lad.
“I wonder we didn’t think of it before. I’ll telegraph
to several of the large cities that are ahead
of us, and ask if there’s any news of an airship
having been seen in their vicinity.”</p>

<p>“But will you wait here until you get answers?”
inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“No,” responded Jerry, after a moment’s consideration.
“We can ask that replies be sent to
us at different places ahead of us. For instance,
the next fair-sized town is Branchville, and the
city beyond that is Canton. We can telegraph to
the chief of police in Canton, and ask that a reply
be sent to us to be called for at Branchville. See
my plan?”</p>

<p>“It’s a good one,” commented Bob. It was at
once put into operation, and that night several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
inquiring messages were being clicked over the
wires, while the boys went to bed to rest up for
the search that lay before them.</p>

<p>They were on the road again, early the next
morning, and while running to Branchville kept a
keen watch on the sky overhead. But the only
specks they saw were birds, and when they inquired
for a telegram, and were handed one, they
had small hopes of any success. Nor was there
any news, the message from the Canton police
chief being to the effect that no airship had been
sighted near there.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got several other places to hear
from before night,” remarked Ned hopefully.
“Let’s get a move on us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jerry, “but we have several more
messages to hear from before night,” his tone,
however, was not quite as confident as it had been.</p>

<p>“Then let’s hit up the pace a little,” suggested
Bob. “Maybe we can get in all our telegrams
before dark.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we can stand a little more speed,”
said the steersman, as he shoved over the gasolene
lever, and advanced his spark. “We’ll hit
up the pace.”</p>

<p>“Be careful you don’t get caught for speeding,”
cautioned Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe any of the constables in
this country township have motorcycles with cyclometers
on,” spoke Jerry, with a laugh. The auto
was now moving swiftly along, but at no illegal
rate of speed. However, it was not more than
ten minutes after this that, as the lads passed a
cross road, they heard some one shout after them:</p>

<p>“Hold on there! You’re goin’ too fast!”</p>

<p>“Better slow up,” advised Ned, after a swift
glance at the man who had warned them. “There’s
a fellow with a motorcycle, Jerry. Maybe he’s a
constable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” was the response, for Jerry
was anxious to get the next telegram, and the auto
kept on.</p>

<p>“He’s coming after us,” announced Bob, when
a backward glance had showed him the man in
pursuit. “He’s coming, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“I heard him,” was the reply, as the explosions
of the smaller machine sounded in the rear. “I
hear him, but we’ll be out of this township in a
few minutes, and he hasn’t any jurisdiction in the
next, where they’re more liberal in the matter of
speed laws.”</p>

<p>So on they kept, the man in the rear, on his
motorcycle, calling to them, at intervals, to stop.</p>

<p>“There,” announced Jerry, as he passed a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
post, “we’re out of his territory now, and he can’t
molest us.” But the motor cyclist still came on,
and, as Jerry slowed up, when nearing a curve,
the man in the rear, with a sudden burst of speed,
swung his machine ahead of the auto. Then,
jumping off, after a quick stop, he placed himself
right in the path, so that Jerry was obliged to
stop, to avoid running him down.</p>

<p>“I’ve caught you!” cried the man. “Maybe
you’ll stop next time I yell at you! You exceeded
the speed limits, and you’re under arrest!”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m Constable Hedden of Analomick township,
and you fellers was running nigh onto forty
miles an hour. I can tell, because I’ve got a cyclometer
that registers the truth. You’re under arrest,
and you’ll have to come before Squire Nashfell,”
and the constable threw back his coat, to
display a large star on his vest. “That’s my authority,”
he added, proudly.</p>

<p>“Are you sure we were going too fast?” asked
Jerry mildly, and his chums were surprised at his
manner.</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Can’t I tell by my register?”</p>

<p>“But we are out of your territory,” put in Ned.
“You have no right to arrest us in this township.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Constable Hedden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
“You violated the speed law in Analomick township,
and I can arrest you wherever I catch you;
and I have you now!”</p>

<p>“Guess you didn’t think of that, Jerry,” remarked
Bob in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” answered the tall lad, in a whisper.
“Just keep still, and say nothing. You and
Ned remain in the car. I’ll settle with this fellow.”
Then, addressing the constable, Jerry went
on: “Well, what are you going to do with us?
We can’t walk back to the office of the Squire
with you, and leave our car here on the road.
Can’t you trust us to come back?”</p>

<p>“Not much! I got bit once, an’ I ain’t goin’ to
again. I’ll ride back with you to the Squire’s
office, an’ prefer a charge against you.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with your motorcycle?”
asked Ned, thinking he could “stump” the constable.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll jest hide it here in the bushes,” replied
the man with a grin. Evidently he was well
pleased with himself at having made such a haul.
“I’m all ready for you automobile fellers these
days,” he continued. “I can hide my wheel where
no one will see it. Then, when the court proceedings
are over, you will have to bring me back here,
and I’ll get my machine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose we refuse?” asked Bob, who saw
visions of a late, if not an altogether postponed,
supper.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you won’t dare refuse to obey an
order of the court,” said Mr. Hedden. “I’ve got
you right, an’ the less trouble you make, the better
off you’ll be.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry, with an ease that
surprised his chums. “Put your machine in the
bushes, and get in.”</p>

<p>“No monkey-business, now mind!” stipulated
the constable. “If I catch you tryin’ to run away
from me, it’ll go hard with you!”</p>

<p>Jerry said nothing, but there was a faint smile
around his mouth, as he watched the constable
carefully place the motor cycle in the bushes,
where it was well out of sight. Then, as Mr.
Hedden came back, the tall lad got out of the car,
and began jacking up one of the front wheels,
raising it, however, only a little way from the
ground.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, quickly.</p>

<p>“Keep still, and you’ll see,” answered Jerry.
Then, when the constable came out of the bushes
that official asked, in some surprise:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter; got a puncture?”</p>

<p>“There might be,” answered Jerry cautiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which was perfectly true. There might have been,
only there wasn’t.</p>

<p>The tall lad began a careful examination of the
front wheel. He turned it slowly around, and
his face wore a puzzled air.</p>

<p>“I had a puncture myself, one day,” went on the
official, “an’ it took quite a while to find it.”</p>

<p>Jerry did not reply. He went to the tool box,
and got a wrench. Then, when he was applying
it to one of the lugs that held the tire in place,
the tool slipped from his hand, and went some
distance across the dusty road.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it!” exclaimed the lad, as if in distress,
and he held one hand in the other, as though
he had hurt himself. Ned and Bob, in the tonneau,
looked on anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it for you!” cried the constable, desirous
to be of some service. Probably he was in a
hurry to get his prisoners arraigned, and fined, so
he could collect his share.</p>

<p>The man with the big badge hurried across
the road to where the wrench had fallen. For an
innocent wrench it had traveled quite a distance,
Ned thought.</p>

<p>No sooner was the man’s back turned that
Jerry, with a quick motion, sprang into the car.
His hand sought the spark lever and swung it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
over. The car could be “started on the spark”
once it had been running for some time, and this
was one of those times. In an instant the welcome
explosions sounded, and, a moment later,
Jerry threw in the clutch. Forward shot the auto,
the jack under the front wheel offering scarcely
any obstacle. It was left lying in the road while
Jerry, throwing in the second speed, was soon far
down the road, leaving a much-astonished constable
staring after the auto and its occupants.</p>

<p>“Here you! Come back here!” he yelled.
“That ain’t fair to git away that way! It’s a
trick! Come back here!”</p>

<p>“Not to-day!” shouted Jerry, as he increased
the speed. “You arrested us by a trick, and we
got away by the same means. We’re even. Besides,
we weren’t exceeding the speed limit, and
you know it,” which was the truth.</p>

<p>The constable, his face distorted with rage, ran
to the bushes where he had left his motorcycle, but
Jerry knew that long before he could get it out,
and in motion, the auto would be so far away
that pursuit would be out of the question.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve seen the last of him,” commented
Ned, with a laugh. “That was a good trick,
Jerry. I didn’t see what you were up to at first.”</p>

<p>“Was there really a puncture?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course not,” answered Jerry. “I did that
to gain time. Then I threw the wrench across
the road, hoping he’d go after it. I knew I could
start on three wheels, and that the jack wouldn’t
stop us, for I only raised it an inch from the
ground. Well, we got out of that all right. Now
for the next telegram.”</p>

<p>Their next stop was at Varden, and the town
they hoped to hear from was Platville. They
found a message awaiting them in the telegraph
office. Nervously Jerry tore it open.</p>

<p>“Any news?” asked Ned, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jerry. “The message reads:
‘Airship disabled about three miles from here.
May be yours.’ Fellows, I guess we’ve run down
Noddy Nixon!”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE AIRSHIP RECOVERED</small></h2>


<p>For a moment after Jerry’s announcement to
his chums, who were in the car, neither of them
spoke. Then Ned said:</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s start at once for Platville.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bob, and, to his credit be it said
that he did not propose stopping for supper,
though he was very hungry.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll have a bite to eat first,” suggested
Jerry. “We want to be in shape to tackle
Noddy and Jack if we come up to them. It won’t
take long to have a meal, and then we’ll go on.”</p>

<p>Bob looked gratefully at his chum, and his face,
that was beginning to wear a woe-begone expression,
took on a more cheerful cast.</p>

<p>“I guess that will be a good plan,” he said, and
Ned laughed.</p>

<p>Platville was about fifty miles farther on, and
they knew that in the darkness, for night was
approaching, and over unfamiliar roads, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
would hardly get there before morning. But this
suited them, as they knew they could scarcely do
anything toward recovering the airship in the
dark.</p>

<p>They went to a hotel where, while they were
getting supper, the auto was looked over by a man
from the garage, and some adjustments made.
Then, with a fresh supply of gasolene and oil, the
seekers after the <i>Comet</i> prepared to resume their
journey. They inquired as to the best road to
take, and Jerry sent a telegram to the chief of
police of Platville, stating that the real owners of
the airship were on their way to claim it. The
chief was requested to send some one out to guard
the craft, and see that the present occupants of it
did not get away with it. To this telegram there
was no answer.</p>

<p>The night journey was begun, and, while it was
pleasant enough at the start, it was soon made
miserable, for it began to rain, and the roads were
slippery and dangerous, necessitating slow progress.
At midnight they stopped at a roadside-inn
to get something to eat, and inquire as to the
progress they had made. The distance covered
was rather disappointing.</p>

<p>“At this rate we won’t get there until nearly
noon,” said Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, there’s one consolation. If the storm
keeps up Noddy won’t be likely to go off in the
airship,” remarked Ned. “He probably thinks
he’s far enough off now so that we can’t catch
him.”</p>

<p>They kept on, the storm becoming worse as they
proceeded. About two o’clock that morning they
ran into a deep mud hole and it took them an hour
to work the auto out.</p>

<p>When they had managed to extricate it, they
were all wet through from the driving rain, and
there was no chance to don dry garments, which
they had in their suit cases.</p>

<p>“This is fierce!” exclaimed Jerry, as he resumed
his place at the steering wheel. “If I had Noddy
Nixon here now, I’d stick him, head first, in that
mud puddle.”</p>

<p>“Let me drive it for a while,” suggested Ned,
“and you go back in the tonneau with Bob.”</p>

<p>To this Jerry agreed, for he was very tired and
there was some protection under the top that covered
the tonneau. He managed to get a little
broken sleep, by curling up on the seat, while Ned
directed the car along the muddy roads.</p>

<p>Morning came at last, and with it the spirits of
the three boys rose somewhat. By signposts they
learned that they were within ten miles of Platville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and, as they got on a highway that was not
so soft, they could make better speed. They were
soon in sight of the city, which nestled in a small
valley.</p>

<p>“Now for a good hot breakfast!” exclaimed
Bob, as he stretched out in his wet garments.
“Then we’ll feel better.”</p>

<p>“The airship first!” insisted Ned, with a look
at Jerry for confirmation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think we can afford to change our clothes
and get on some dry garments,” said the older
lad. “If the ship is disabled I don’t fancy Noddy
can repair it in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“If it’s damaged he’ll pay for it!” exploded
Bob vindictively, and his chums nodded.</p>

<p>They went to a hotel, and arranged for a room,
for they could not tell how long they would have
to stay. The clerk looked a little askance at the
three rain-soaked lads who entered the lobby that
early morning, but when he knew that they were
autoists a different expression came over his face,
and his manner was more cordial.</p>

<p>“Which means that he’ll about double our bill,”
commented Jerry, as he and his chums went to
their rooms.</p>

<p>They made hasty toilets, and, after a quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
breakfast they drove to the office of the chief of
police.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it’s the machine you
want or not,” remarked that official, when they
told their errand, “but there’s an aeroplane down
in a field about two miles outside of town. It came
there yesterday afternoon, and seems to be out
of kilter.”</p>

<p>“Did you send a man out to guard it?” asked
Jerry, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Man to guard it? No.”</p>

<p>“We telegraphed you, asking you to do that,”
went on the widow’s son. “The chaps who stole
it may take a notion to keep on with it, after they
get it fixed.”</p>

<p>“I never got that second telegram,” said the
police officer. “I’m sorry. But I’ll go right out
with you now, and do all I can to help you get
it back. Stealing airships, eh? What will happen
next, I wonder?”</p>

<p>It was with anxious hearts that the three chums,
accompanied by the chief, drove out in the auto
to the field where the <i>Comet</i> was supposed to be.
Would it still be there, or had Noddy and Jack
managed to repair it, and continue their flight?
These were questions that each of the three lads
asked himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you see the airship?” asked Jerry, of the
chief.</p>

<p>“Yes, I went out to take a look at it yesterday
afternoon, when I got your message,” replied the
official. “But as you didn’t say that it was stolen,
I didn’t take any action. I supposed you were
only one of the owners interested in seeing how
far it had traveled.”</p>

<p>“Who was in it?” asked Ned, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, there were two young fellows, and an
old man. And the old man didn’t seem to know
much about airships. He was very quiet, but the
two young men were quarreling between themselves
as to who was responsible for the accident.
It seems they lost the gas from the bag, and in
coming down they broke one of the wings, if
that’s what you call ’em.”</p>

<p>“I guess you mean one of the side planes,”
spoke Jerry. “Well, if that’s all the damage, we
can soon fix it. So Mr. Bell is still with them,
eh? But we’ll soon explain matters to him, and
I guess he won’t want anything more to do with
Noddy Nixon and Jack Pender.”</p>

<p>The auto swung around a bend in the road.
The storm had ceased, and the weather was fine.
As the boys looked off to the right they saw, glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in the sun, in a big field, a shape that was
familiar to them. Bob uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“The <i>Comet</i>!”</p>

<p>“There she is!” shouted Ned enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“And not so badly damaged as I feared,” added
Jerry as his eyes took in the outlines of the airship.</p>

<p>“Better leave the auto here,” suggested the
chief. “That meadow is soft, after the rain, and
you’ll sink in.”</p>

<p>They dismounted from the car, and eagerly ran
across the field toward the airship, the chief following
more slowly.</p>

<p>“There was quite a crowd out to see it yesterday,”
the official remarked, “but one of the boys,
Pixon or Snixon I think his name was,&mdash;he acted
so mean, and talked of shooting anyone who came
too close,&mdash;that the crowd thought it would be
healthier to keep away. Then, too, he said the
gas was dangerous, and might kill people.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Jerry. “The only way it
could kill anyone would be for that person to be
shut up in a room full of it. There is no danger.
But that’s just like Noddy Nixon. I guess he
didn’t want news that the airship was here to get
out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“The man who owns the field made him pay for
leaving it here over night,” went on the chief of
police.</p>

<p>As the three chums approached nearer and
nearer to the craft they looked for signs of life
about it. The <i>Comet</i> was resting on nearly an
even “keel” in the midst of a big green meadow.
But, look as they did, the motor boys saw no one.</p>

<p>Jerry, who was in the lead, was now within
twenty-five feet of the <i>Comet</i>. He was narrowly
watching it, and suddenly he saw a figure emerge
from the cabin.</p>

<p>“Hi there! Jack Pender!” cried the tall lad, as
he broke into a run.</p>

<p>Jack Pender gave one look, uttered a warning
yell, and then leaped over the side of the airship
and ran across the meadow at full speed. An instant
later another figure emerged from the cabin.
It was that of Noddy Nixon. He, too, took in
the situation at a glance, and saw the three motor
boys and the chief of police.</p>

<p>Noddy tried to follow the example of Pender,
his crony. He leaped over the side of the craft,
but he was not so lucky in recovering his balance.
Before he could run Jerry was upon him.</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got you!” cried the tall lad, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Noddy by the collar. “I’ll teach you to steal our
airship!”</p>

<p>“You let me alone!” blustered Noddy, and he
began to punch Jerry. This was more than Jerry
could stand, and he turned in and gave the bully
the best thrashing he had received in some time.
It did not take long, either, for Jerry was thoroughly
and righteously angry, and Noddy was like
a lump of putty when it came to fighting. By the
time Ned, Bob and the chief had come up, the
bully was in a pitiable state.</p>

<p>“There, you get out of this, and thank your
stars that you’re not arrested on a serious charge,”
said Jerry indignantly, as he gave the ugly-faced
lad a shove that sent him head-first into a puddle
of water.</p>

<p>“You wait, Jerry Hopkins!” spluttered Noddy,
as he got up. “I’ll fix you for this,” but he did
not stay to talk further, for Jerry advanced toward
him. Off over the fields, after Jack Pender,
ran the discomfited bully.</p>

<p>“See anything of Mr. Bell?” inquired Ned, as
he, with Bob and the chief, followed Jerry into the
cabin of the airship.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to be around,” was the
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>It needed but a glance about the <i>Comet</i> to show
that the hermit was not aboard.</p>

<p>“I guess he must have gone away in the night,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“Probably he couldn’t stand Noddy and Jack,
or else he found out the trick they had played,”
suggested Jerry. “But now let’s see what damage
has been done, for we have our airship back again,
and have routed the enemy,” and he smiled as if
something pleased him.</p>

<p>“Here’s something that may give you a clew
to things,” commented the chief of police, handing
a letter to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” asked the lad.</p>

<p>“That chap dropped it when he was having
that little argument with you,” replied the official
with a smile, as he thought of the strenuous “argument”
that had taken place between Jerry and
Noddy.</p>

<p>“It’s a letter, addressed to Noddy,” said Jerry,
as he looked at it. “I think we’re justified in
reading it. Only part of it is here, but it may
interest us.” He read the fragment rapidly and
a change came over his face.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bob anxiously.</p>

<p>“This letter is from Tom Dalsett,” replied
Jerry. “Tom Dalsett, who with Noddy, Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Pender, and some others of that gang, made trouble
for us in Mexico and at our Western mine.
Dalsett writes to Noddy to come on out west, as
he says he thinks there is a chance to beat us out
of our claim to the gold mine, and put Jim Nestor,
our foreman, out of possession.”</p>

<p>“The idea!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” went on Jerry eagerly, “this is why
Noddy was so anxious to get out West! He wants
to steal our gold mine away from us, with the
help of Dalsett and his gang. This letter is a
valuable clew.”</p>

<p>“But what of Jackson Bell, the hermit?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jerry, somewhat
puzzled. “That is another part of the mystery.
But we’ve got our work cut out for us now, boys.
We’ve got to go West and protect our mine from
the same gang who tried, once before, to get it
away from us. We’ll go in the airship, as soon
as it’s repaired. We caught Noddy just in time.”</p>

<p>“And will we let Mr. Bell’s friends, in the
mysterious valley, suffer?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, we’ll save them, too, if we can. There are
plenty of adventures ahead of us,” finished Jerry,
as he folded the letter and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Do you want to arrest those two fellows?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
asked the chief, pointing in the direction taken by
Noddy and Jack.</p>

<p>“No, let them go,” advised Jerry. “We’ll see
if we can find Mr. Bell, and then we’ll repair the
ship and start for the West.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A TRACE OF MR. BELL</small></h2>


<p>The boys were not long in assuring themselves
that their airship had suffered no material damage.
The lifting gas, which was contained in the
big bag, had simply leaked away, and of course
Noddy and Jack Pender did not know how to
make any more. In consequence of this they had
been obliged to use the craft simply as an aeroplane,
the dirigible balloon feature being eliminated.
They were evidently not enough skilled in
aeronautics to keep the craft constantly in motion,
and so it had descended in the field, one of the
planes, and a deflecting rudder, being broken, but
not beyond repair.</p>

<p>“Those fellows certainly lived high while they
were aboard,” grumbled Bob, after a visit to the
storeroom. “They have wasted as much stuff as
they ate.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose that worries you,” suggested
Jerry, with a smile. “Never mind, Chunky, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
long as we have our airship back we won’t complain.”</p>

<p>“Not after the way you licked Noddy,” added
Ned. “I was wishing I could have a hand in it,
but you finished him off too quick for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I fancy he’ll remember it for a few
hours,” put in the chief of police. “Well, boys,”
he added, “is there anything I can do for you?
Do you want me to make a search for this Nixon
fellow and the other one, or for this Mr. Bell?
Is he a criminal, too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he is a very good friend of ours,”
Jerry hastened to say. “He is an old man, who
once was a sort of hermit out West, near a lost
lake that very few persons knew about. We
found him and restored a long-lost son to him.
But we have not seen him since. Accidentally we
learned that he was with these two bullies in the
airship, though why we don’t exactly know. But
we certainly don’t want him arrested, though he
seems to have disappeared.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it. Jackson Bell was
not in the craft, though whether he had recently
left, or had gone some time before the arrival of
the three chums, was impossible to say.</p>

<p>“Well, if I can’t do anything for you I think
I’ll go back to town,” went on the chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jerry, “and Ned and Bob had
better go with you, in the auto. I’ll stay here,”
continued the tall youth, “and guard the airship.
You and Bob, Ned, can buy the things necessary
with which to repair it, and we’ll make a flight
from here as soon as we can get it in shape.”</p>

<p>“To rescue Mr. Bell and his friends?” asked
Bob, who was contentedly munching a sandwich
he had made from some canned chicken he found
among the stores.</p>

<p>“Hardly, unless we can tell where they are,”
answered Jerry. “We’ll go west to protect our
mine, for this looks as if there was another conspiracy
on foot against us,” and he held up the
letter that had fallen from Noddy’s pocket.
“We’ll have to teach Tom Dalsett and that gang
another lesson, I guess. I only hope Jim Nestor
will be on his guard. I think we’d better send
him a telegram of warning, and let him know
we are coming. I’ll write it, and you fellows can
take it to town when you go in the auto.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in too much of a hurry,” advised
Bob. “I think I’ll make another sandwich. Don’t
you want one?” and he started for the kitchen of
the airship.</p>

<p>“Here, you cut that out!” ordered Ned, good-naturedly.
“Work first and eat afterward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob looked a little disconsolate, but complied
with his friend’s desire. Jerry had quickly written
a telegram, and given it to Ned, who, with
Bob and the chief of police, started across the
field to where the auto had been left. They were
soon speeding toward town.</p>

<p>Left alone in the airship Jerry strolled about it,
taking note of the various features, and marking
with displeasure where the carelessness of Noddy
and Jack had done some slight damage.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> is fully described in the ninth book
of this series, entitled “The Motor Boys in the
Clouds,” but perhaps a brief statement of the
wonderful craft may not be out of place here.
The airship consisted of two sections. There was
the big cigar-shaped bag, which contained the gas,
and which formed the dirigible balloon part of
the ship. This bag was filled with a strong lifting
vapor, of secret composition.</p>

<p>Then there was the aeroplane feature, the big
wings being fitted at right angles to the gas bag,
and strongly braced. Thus the <i>Comet</i> could be
used as a balloon, or, at the will of the occupants,
or in case of accident, could glide along like an
aeroplane.</p>

<p>Below the big bag was the body of the ship,
consisting of an enclosed framework, divided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
several compartments. There was a living room,
or cabin, a room where several berths provided
ample sleeping accommodations, the motor or engine
room, and a cooking galley. From the engine
room the big propellers, two of them, could
be controlled, as could also the rudders, one designed
to send the ship to right or left, and the
other to elevate or depress it. There was a small
pilot house for the steersman, and windows in the
cabin affording a view on all sides, while heavy
glass ones in the bottom of the car enabled the
occupants to look down on the earth below. There
were lockers for the storage of food, supplies and
the necessary materials for making the lifting gas
on board, so that, if necessary, the bag could be
filled even while the ship was in motion.</p>

<p>Jerry walked all about the craft, noting every
feature. He saw that comparatively few repairs
would be needed before he and his chums could
set sail in it.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start for the west,” Jerry said,
talking to himself. “We’ll have to hustle to beat
Noddy and that gang, for they evidently expect
to get that gold mine away from us if they can.
Then there’s this matter of Mr. Bell. I can’t
understand that at all. Why was he with Noddy?
What did he want of an airship? Was he really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
here at all, or was it some one who looked like
him, and who helped Noddy to steal our <i>Comet</i>?
I wish I could answer those questions. Maybe it
wasn’t Mr. Bell, after all. It might have been
one of the Dalsett gang, dressed up to represent
him.”</p>

<p>As he thought of this possibility Jerry became
uneasy. He began to wish Bob and Ned would
return, for he feared Noddy might come back at
any minute, accompanied by some of the scoundrels
with whom he associated, and regain possession
of the airship. But, as he thought of the
broken plane, and realized that there was scarcely
any gas in the bag, Jerry knew that whoever
came could not run away with the flying craft.</p>

<p>He walked through the cabin again, and near
one of the seats he noticed some torn pieces of
paper. Idly he picked them up, and, as he scanned
them, thinking more of the recent events he had
passed through than of anything else, he saw that
the fragments bore writing. One of the pieces
contained a name&mdash;Thomas Bell&mdash;and at the
sight of that Jerry uttered a cry:</p>

<p>“Tommy Bell!” he exclaimed. “Why that’s
the name of Mr. Bell’s son&mdash;the one we rescued
from the Mexicans! This looks like a letter written
to him, and afterward destroyed. I wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
if I can make out anything from it? I’ll try, for
maybe he and Mr. Bell are in trouble, and I can
help them.”</p>

<p>With nervous fingers Jerry sought to piece together
the fragments of the torn letter. But it
was not all there. Only disconnected words could
be made out, but from these the tall lad decided
that it was a missive written by Jackson Bell to
his son, but, for some reason, torn up before it
was sent. And from the words he could decipher
Jerry felt that he held in his hands some clew to
the mystery&mdash;the mystery of the air, which Mr.
Bell had set out to solve with Noddy and Jack,
who had deceived him. For Jerry read such
words as “will try to help them,” “can now get
to the deep valley,” “they may yet be alive,”
“Noddy is friend of the motor boys&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s where he’s wrong,” commented Jerry,
grimly. Then he found a larger fragment, which
he had overlooked. It contained these words:
“and so Tommy, my boy, you may soon expect me
back in the west, and together we will go to the
aid of those people, some of whom were my
friends, so long and so mysteriously lost. I feel
that we can save them in the airship, which I
thought of as a last resort, after reading what
Jerry Hopkins and his chums had done in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wonderful craft. I will soon be with you. <span class="smcap">Jackson
Bell.</span>”</p>

<p>“Jackson Bell!” cried Jerry, springing to his
feet, and staring at the signature on the scrap of
paper. “Then Mr. Bell has been here&mdash;in this
ship&mdash;there is no doubt of it! He wrote this
letter to his son, but it was torn up, and never
posted. Can there have been foul play here?
Have Noddy and Jack made away with Mr.
Bell?” The thought was too terrible. Jerry dismissed
it at once, yet he could not help adding:</p>

<p>“The mystery is deepening. There are three
puzzles now to solve. How to save our mine,
how to rescue the people of the valley, and how
to find Mr. Bell.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>HOME IN THE AIRSHIP</small></h2>


<p>Jerry sat in the cabin of the <i>Comet</i>, staring
at the fragment of paper bearing the signature of
Mr. Bell. Many thoughts were in the mind of
the lad. He was worried and puzzled. Clews
seemed to point to a sudden departure of the
former hermit from the airship. The torn letter
was one of them.</p>

<p>“Of course,” reasoned Jerry, “Mr. Bell may
have written the letter, and then, desiring to
change something in it, he may have destroyed it,
and written another, which he sent. But it looks
as if he had hurried away from this ship.” This
was true enough, for, all about, were evidences of
a hasty flight. Bits of paper and string were scattered
about, as if some one had packed up on
short notice.</p>

<p>“But if Mr. Bell wrote to his son that he was
coming in an airship to help rescue some people
in a mysterious valley, why isn’t he on hand now?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
reasoned Jerry, questioning himself. “Surely a
slight accident to the <i>Comet</i> wouldn’t scare him.
He ought to be around here, waiting for Noddy
to fix it. But he isn’t. Evidently something happened
just before we arrived on the scene.”</p>

<p>Jerry was right in this surmise, but it was not
until some time afterward that he learned what
had taken place, and the reason for the letter
being torn up and scattered about the cabin.</p>

<p>Still musing on the mute evidence of the mystery,
Jerry began a search for more fragments,
thinking that, if he had the whole letter, he could
piece it together. He was interrupted in his
search by a shout from without, and he hurried
out on deck. To his relief he saw Ned and Bob
approaching, carrying as many packages as their
arms would hold.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Jerry?” called Ned, anxiously.</p>

<p>“All right,” responded his chum, “and I’ve
made a great discovery.”</p>

<p>“Have you found Mr. Bell?”</p>

<p>“No, but something concerning him. Come
aboard. Did you get the things to fix the airship?”</p>

<p>“Yes; everything.”</p>

<p>“Then come here; I’ve got news for you,” and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
as his chums crowded closer, Jerry told them of
finding the scraps of the mysterious letter. They
eagerly scanned the fragments, making many comments
on them, but agreeing, in general, with
Jerry’s view.</p>

<p>For some time they talked over the possibilities
of what might have happened, and they concluded
that the thing to do was to leave for the west as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a trip over the Rockies,” declared
Jerry, “and clear up this mystery. But the first
thing to do, is to repair the airship.”</p>

<p>The bundles Bob and Ned had brought from
town consisted of piano wire and bamboo poles,
for strengthening the frame of the aeroplane, stout
canvas for mending the torn places, some chemicals
for making the gas, and other supplies. The
packages were opened and the contents spread out
on the deck. Then another inspection of the
<i>Comet</i> was made to determine what to repair
first. Jerry made up a sort of schedule, giving
himself as well as his two chums enough work to
keep them busy all that day.</p>

<p>It was well that the three lads had assisted Mr.
Glassford in the manufacture of the airship, for
now they were at no loss as to how to proceed.
They knew every inch of the craft, and, if necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
could have taken it apart and put it together
again.</p>

<p>They worked rapidly, and were about to stop
for dinner, in response to several impatient and
pathetic consultations that Bob gave his watch,
when, across the meadows, quite a crowd was seen
approaching the stalled airship.</p>

<p>“Here comes a lot of curiosity seekers,” announced
Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t help it, and we’ve got to expect
it,” answered Jerry. “Make the best of it,
but don’t let any of ’em come aboard. They may
do some damage.”</p>

<p>The throng consisted, for the most part, of
boys and men, though there were a few young
women in it. They all gazed at the airship in open-mouthed
wonder, but they showed a commendable
desire to keep some distance back.</p>

<p>“I guess Noddy’s bluff about the gas being likely
to explode, or kill people, was a good thing,”
announced Ned. “It will keep them back.”</p>

<p>The boys made a hasty lunch, and reviewed
their work of repairing the ship. The crowd grew
larger and completely surrounded the stalled
<i>Comet</i>. Toward the middle of the afternoon the
throng was very dense, and some of the lads in it,
becoming bold, by the fact that nothing had happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
began to run up on the deck when Jerry,
Ned and Bob were off to one side.</p>

<p>“There’ll be trouble if we don’t look out,” said
Jerry in a low voice to his chums. “Here, you
get out of that!” he yelled to a daring youngster
who had entered the pilot house, and was yanking
on the wheels and levers.</p>

<p>Others in the crowd, emboldened by the feat
of this lad, began to climb upon the airship, and
our heroes would soon have been overwhelmed by
eager, if kindly, curious investigators. The trouble,
however, was speedily over, for several police
officers unexpectedly arrived on the scene, and reported
to Jerry. They said they had been sent
out by the chief, who had instructed them to keep
the crowd back.</p>

<p>This they at once proceeded to do, and the lads
were not further hampered by the throng, but
could proceed with the repair work in peace.</p>

<p>That night the most of it was done, and the
following day, after sleeping on board the <i>Comet</i>,
it was resumed. The crowd was larger than ever
the second day, but more police were on hand and
no harm resulted. Late that afternoon Jerry announced
that he was ready for a trial flight.</p>

<p>“Are you going to put right for Cresville?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, we’ll go up a short distance, circle around,
and see how the ship behaves,” answered Jerry.
“Then we’ll start for home in the morning. We’ll
need a little time to stock up the cupboard,
Chunky,” and the tall lad winked at Ned, while
Bob blushed at this tribute to his eating powers.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll have to arrange to have the
auto taken care of,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll ship that home by freight,” decided
Jerry.</p>

<p>It was soon circulated through the crowd that
the airship was going to ascend, and the people
crowded up so close that it was with difficulty that
the boys could move about. But when Jerry,
speaking loudly on purpose, told Ned and Bob to
start the gas generating machine, there was a sudden
movement of the big audience.</p>

<p>“That made ’em skedaddle!” exclaimed Ned
with a laugh, though there was no danger.</p>

<p>In a short time the big gas bag was filled with
the powerful vapor, and the airship began tugging
at the guy ropes with which it was fastened to the
earth. The boys looked carefully over every part,
and then entered the cabin, to see that the controlling
mechanism was in working order.</p>

<p>“I’ll steer first,” said Jerry. “Ned, you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Bob be ready to cast off the ropes when I give the
word.”</p>

<p>The tall lad took his place in the pilot house.
The indicator connected with the gas machine
showed that enough vapor had been made to raise
the ship without the use of the aeroplane feature.
Jerry shut off the gas, and pulled the lever to get
the planes and rudders in the right position.</p>

<p>“All ready?” he asked his chums.</p>

<p>“All ready,” replied Bob and Ned.</p>

<p>Everyone in the crowd seemed to be holding
his breath.</p>

<p>“Cast off!” cried Jerry, and his chums released
the holding ropes. Up shot the big airship, like
a bird released from captivity. The crowd yelled
and cheered. Up and up went the <i>Comet</i>. Then
Jerry started the two big propellers, and the craft
darted forward. Sending it up about a thousand
feet, Jerry guided the ship about in a series of
evolutions, designed to test the various planes
and rudders. To his delight, it answered the helm
perfectly. Noddy’s possession of the ship had,
seemingly, not permanently harmed it any. Back
and forth, around in circles and through figure
eights, went the <i>Comet</i>, while the crowd below
looked up in wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess it’s all right,” announced Jerry, after
about an hour’s test. “We’ll go down, now.”</p>

<p>“Down she goes!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>So perfectly was the airship under control that
Jerry landed it in almost exactly the same spot
from where he had arisen. There was applause
from the crowd at this feat of steersmanship.</p>

<p>There were only a few more adjustments to
make before the <i>Comet</i> would be ready for the
long trip to Cresville, and from there she would
be sent over the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The crowd lingered until dark, and then dispersed.
Jerry went into town, and arranged to
have the auto shipped home, and also paid a visit
to the chief of police, thanking him for the
services of himself and his men. Then Jerry went
back to where his chums were on the airship.</p>

<p>In the morning, before a curious crowd had
time to assemble, the motor boys had started the
engines of the <i>Comet</i>, and were soon up amid the
clouds, heading straight for Cresville.</p>

<p>“And the biggest part of our journey is still to
come,” observed Ned, gazing down toward the
earth.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the most mysterious,” spoke Bob, but
neither he nor his chums knew how many wonderful
things were before them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>PROFESSOR SNODGRASS ON HAND</small></h2>


<p>Cresville was reached, without incident, in
much less time than the journey had taken our
friends in the auto. They had but one slight accident.
A leak was discovered in one of the compartments
of the gas bag, but no stop was made to
repair it, as the ship could be used independently
of the bag, as an aeroplane. The leak was of
small importance from the fact that the bag was
divided into several sections, so that if one or two
were emptied of gas the <i>Comet</i> would still be
buoyant.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” announced Ned, the same afternoon
that they had left Platville, and he looked
toward a town that was looming up into sight.
“There’s Cresville.”</p>

<p>The boys’ parents were anxiously awaiting their
arrival for, though they had been informed by
telegraph of the success of the quest, they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
know all that had taken place. The story of the
chase, and the disappearance of Mr. Bell, was
soon told.</p>

<p>“Is Noddy Nixon back in town?” inquired Bob,
of his father.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Mr. Baker. “But I
wouldn’t have anything to do with him, if I were
you.”</p>

<p>“We don’t intend to,” spoke Ned, “only we’d
like to get on the track of that mystery.”</p>

<p>Inquiries, however, showed that Noddy had not
come back. Nor had Jack Pender, and as Mr.
Nixon was a man who never considered that his
son did wrong, there was little use in appealing
to him.</p>

<p>“We’ll work this out ourselves,” decided Jerry,
and his chums agreed with him. The airship was
housed in the shed, and, when the broken bolts on
the big front doors had been repaired, Sud Snuffles
was again placed in charge, with strict orders
to admit no one except the motor boys, or some
one accompanied by them.</p>

<p>“And you can make up your minds that I’ll be
careful,” declared Sud, feeling of the lump on his
head, which swelling was still in evidence. “They’ll
have to get rid of me first, before they get in this
shed now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>That night there was a consultation among the
motor boys and their parents. Jerry showed the
letter Noddy had dropped, which seemed to indicate
that an attempt would be made on the part
of Noddy and his cronies to get control of the
gold mine in Arizona.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to go out there,” declared
Jerry, “to protect our mine, and also to see if we
can’t locate Mr. Bell and his mysterious friends,
whom he is so anxious to aid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry, are you going on another one of
those dangerous trips?” exclaimed Mrs. Hopkins,
in much anxiety.</p>

<p>“It’s not so dangerous, mother. We always
come safely back from them.”</p>

<p>“You have, so far,” remarked Mr. Slade. “But
there is no telling. I don’t much fancy airships.”</p>

<p>“They are safer than automobiles,” declared
Bob. “You can’t hit anything in the air.”</p>

<p>“No, but you can come down and hit the earth
pretty hard,” observed his father, grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, but we don’t intend to come down,” said
Ned. “Can’t we go, dad?”</p>

<p>The parents considered the matter in a sort of
executive session, the boys being barred. Finally
the lads were called into the library of Mrs. Hopkins’s
home, where the conference was taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
place. The boys looked anxiously at the faces
of the older folks.</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Jerry nervously.</p>

<p>“You may go,” replied his mother, with a little
catch in her voice. “But you must promise to be
very careful. You are going on a long trip&mdash;across
the Rocky Mountains, as I understand it&mdash;and
there may be all sorts of dangers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be careful,” readily promised Jerry,
and his chums eagerly assented.</p>

<p>Once all objections to their trip were removed,
the boys lost no time in making their preparations.
There was little to do to the <i>Comet</i> as it
was nearly ready for a flight across the continent,
but supplies and provisions must be put aboard
and these took some time. At length, however,
all was in readiness.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll give it a trial to-morrow,” said
Jerry to his chums one night. “I want to see how
the deflecting rudder works since I changed the
angle. Then, if all is well, we’ll start the next
day.”</p>

<p>As the three chums were about ready to start
on the little test trip the following day, having
run the airship out of the shed, they heard voices
in conversation on the side of the gas bag opposite
to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, would you dare take a trip?” asked some
one, evidently, from the tones, a young lady.</p>

<p>“I would if they asked me, but I don’t suppose
they will,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Jerry looked under the bag, and caught a
glimpse of three girls. Without changing his
position, he called out:</p>

<p>“You may consider that you are asked, Mollie.
Would you and Helen and Alice like to take a
little trip?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness me! I didn’t s’pose anyone
was around!” exclaimed Mollie Horton, who
lived near Ned Slade.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare go one step in it!” cried Alice
Vines, while Helen Gale, another chum, joined
her protest.</p>

<p>“How are you, girls?” greeted Jerry, as he
and his companions went around where they
could see the young ladies. “You may come for
a trip, if you like. We’re not going very high,
and there’s not the slightest danger.”</p>

<p>“Will you go, girls?” asked Mollie, of her
friends.</p>

<p>They hesitated. Clearly they would like the
experience, yet they hardly dared. While they
were debating with themselves they were startled
by hearing some one exclaim:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here we go&mdash;up in the air&mdash;above the clouds&mdash;down
again&mdash;sail like a bird&mdash;turn a somersault&mdash;hit
a star&mdash;bound for the moon&mdash;whoop!
May I go?”</p>

<p>“You may if you will say that all over again,
and repeat it slowly, backwards, Andy,” stipulated
Jerry, as he caught sight of the excitable
little chap. Andy tried, but it was of no use.
His tongue got all “twisted” as Bob said.
However, the small lad was so enthusiastic
over a chance for a trip, and he
seemed so fearless that the terrors of Alice and
Helen were overcome, after a little more persuasion,
in which Mollie did her share. The
three girls and Andy Rush entered the cabin, not,
however, without many exclamations, half of
anxiety and half of pleasure. Then Jerry and
his chums started the power, and they were soon
sailing through the air. Owing to the timidity
of the young ladies no very great height was
reached, though Andy was constantly urging
Jerry to go above the clouds. They descended
without anything having happened.</p>

<p>“Why, how simple it all is!” exclaimed Alice
Vines, as she stepped on the ground again.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s easier than managing an automobile,”
added Helen Gale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Except in a big wind,” said Jerry. “We’ll
take you out in a storm, sometime.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” objected Mollie. “We’re
much obliged as it is,” and then the girls waved
a farewell to the boys.</p>

<p>The weather the following day proved all that
could be desired. The boys were up early, for
there were several small matters to attend to, but
finally all was in readiness for the start over the
Rockies.</p>

<p>Jerry had safely put away the letter Noddy
had dropped, and he had the torn fragments of
the one written by Mr. Bell. He thought he
might need them as evidence.</p>

<p>There was quite a crowd assembled at the airship
shed to see the start, and the parents of
our heroes were there.</p>

<p>“Be sure and drop a letter occasionally,” called
Mrs. Hopkins, to her son, and Jerry promised,
while Ned and Bob also agreed to write to their
parents.</p>

<p>“Is everything all right?” asked Jerry of his
chums. He was in the pilot house, and his two
companions were on deck.</p>

<p>“All ready to cast off,” announced Bob.</p>

<p>“Then let her go!” cried Jerry. “Good-bye,
everybody!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-bye! Good-bye!” shouted their friends
and parents.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” cried Bob and Ned in a chorus.</p>

<p>They were about to release the ropes holding
the airship to the earth when there was a sudden
commotion in the crowd. It seemed to separate
into two parts, and through the middle came running
an odd figure.</p>

<p>It was that of a small man, with a bald head,
which was easily discernible since his hat had
fallen off. He was running as fast as he could.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Hold on, boys!” he cried. “Wait
for me. I want to go with you!” His coat tails
were flying out behind him like sails. Over one
shoulder was a long-handled butterfly net, and
slung on his back was a green box. The cover
of the box had come open, and from it were falling
all sorts of bugs, toads, lizards and insects.
“Wait! Wait!” cried the little man. “Don’t go
without me! I want to capture a new kind of
flying lizard. Wait! Wait!”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob held on to the partly loosened
guy ropes. The little man looked at the departing
airship, and glanced back along the route he
had traveled through the crowd&mdash;a route marked
by all sorts of flying, creeping and hopping things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait, oh, wait, I beg of you!” he pleaded.
“Am I too late? I must get that flying lizard!”</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” gasped Jerry, as he
caught sight of the odd figure. “You’re just in
time, Professor!” he shouted, leaning from the
window of the pilot house. “Hold the ship for a
minute, Bob and Ned, until the professor gets
aboard. We never could go without him!”</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR THE WEST</small></h2>


<p>Professor Snodgrass fairly leaped aboard the
airship. Bob and Ned, abandoning their work
of casting off the ropes, which they again fastened,
held out their hands to him, and he grasped
them firmly.</p>

<p>“Safe on board!” gasped the scientist. “I
feared I would be left!”</p>

<p>“You’re all right!” shouted an enthusiastic admirer
in the throng.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added Andy Rush. “Come at
last minute&mdash;almost left&mdash;rush on board&mdash;never
mind the crowd&mdash;jump in the air&mdash;fall down&mdash;get
up&mdash;see the bugs! Whoop!”</p>

<p>“Bugs? Bugs? What bugs? Are there any
bugs I can capture here?” asked the professor
turning around to face the crowd from the deck
of the airship. Evidently he was unaware that
his specimen box had come open in his flight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that his path was strewn with creeping and crawling
things.</p>

<p>“Bugs! I should say there were bugs!” exclaimed
a woman. “One of the terrible creatures
is on me now! It has seven wings and about
fifty legs! Ugh! Take him off me, somebody;
do!”</p>

<p>“Seven wings!” cried the professor, excitedly.
“Why, my dear madam, that is one of the most
wonderful and rare creatures in existence! There
is only one known, and I have it. It is a sort of
dragon-fly-centipede. Don’t move, I beg of you,
and I will capture it in a moment. I wonder
where it came from?”</p>

<p>“From your box, Professor,” said Jerry, coming
from the pilot house. “Your box is open
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, my good gracious! So it is!” exclaimed
the scientist with a groan. “All my valuable
insects have escaped! That seven-winged centipede
is one of them. Help me to capture them,
boys, I beg of you!”</p>

<p>“Everybody get busy!” sang out Andy Rush.
“Capture the professor’s specimens!”</p>

<p>“I’ll kill this seven-winged beast if some one
doesn’t take it off me!” screamed the woman.</p>

<p>“Don’t! Don’t! I beg of you! Handle it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
gently,” pleaded Uriah Snodgrass, as he prepared
to get off the airship. “I will take it from you
in a minute,” and he got his small net ready.</p>

<p>“There’s some sort of a toad crawling up my
leg!” yelled a man. “Do you want that, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Do I want it? I should say I did, my dear
sir. That is related to the celebrated horned
toad that I captured after a long chase, on a
journey to California. Please hold it for me. I
will be there in a moment; as soon as I have captured
the seven-winged centipede.”</p>

<p>“Will it bite?” asked the man, as he gingerly
extended his hand toward the reptile.</p>

<p>“It’s as harmless as an elephant,” responded
Mr. Snodgrass enthusiastically, for to him one
animal was very like another; he feared none, and
they all seemed to like him.</p>

<p>By this time Bob, Ned and Jerry were laughing
so heartily that they could not be of much
service to their friend. He seemed all unconscious
of the excitement he had created in the
crowd, and his only desire was to recapture his
specimens. There was an uneasy movement in
the throng, as women or girls found themselves
confronted by a snake or a lizard.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurt any of them, I beg of you,” pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the professor. “I will soon have all my beauties
safe,” and with a quick motion he captured
the curious insect that had lighted on the woman
who first gave the alarm.</p>

<p>“Beauties!” exclaimed another woman, with a
sniff. “Look what he calls ‘beauties!’” and she
pointed at a squatty toad that was trying to hide
under a stone.</p>

<p>“Don’t step on it,” cried the scientist. “I’ll
have it safe in a moment,” and, with a quick motion,
he cast the net over it, and transferred the
toad to the green box.</p>

<p>“There’s some sort of a big bee trying to sting
me!” came a boy’s voice, from the outer edge of
the crowd. “I’m going to swat it good and hard
if it does.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t! Pray don’t!” pleaded Uriah
Snodgrass. “That is the only specimen of a
buzzless bumble bee that I have ever seen. It
is very valuable. If it stings you just stand still,
and it can’t get away. Then I’ll catch it. Don’t
disturb it if it stings you!”</p>

<p>“Hu! Guess I’d like to see myself!” retorted
the boy. Then he gave a yell. “It’s stinging me
now!” he screamed. “I’m going to swat it good
and hard!”</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” begged the professor, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
tried to get through the crowd to where the lad
was, hopping about in pain. Just then the youth
yelled again.</p>

<p>“It’s flown off me,” he said, “and it’s on John
Stubb now! Look out, John, or it will bite you!”</p>

<p>“You put it on me on purpose,” complained
John. “I’ll kill it!”</p>

<p>But by this time Professor Snodgrass was on
hand and had made a prisoner of the buzzless
bumble bee.</p>

<p>Then a woman reported that a snake was coiled
up in front of her, and about to strike, and the
scientist hastened over and captured that, stating
that the snake was a harmless one. By this time
the three motor boys, and some of their friends,
had managed to capture most of the other specimens,
and restore them to the green box. The
crowd quieted down, and Uriah Snodgrass made
a hasty examination to see if he had all his treasures.</p>

<p>“Any missing?” asked Jerry, trying not to
laugh at his eccentric friend.</p>

<p>“There seems to be a pink flea gone,” was the
answer. Then, addressing the throng, the scientist
asked: “Has anyone a pink flea?”</p>

<p>“My dog has lots of fleas, but I don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
whether they’re pink or red,” replied an irreverent
youth, and there was a laugh, which ended
when a little girl cried out:</p>

<p>“There’s something like a pink mosquito biting
me, mister.”</p>

<p>“Ha! That may be it. Let it bite you, little
girl. It won’t hurt much,” the professor said,
hurrying to the child. Then he gave a delighted
cry. “It’s my pink flea! A very valuable specimen!
Now I have all of them back again. You
may start the airship, boys. I’ll have to put a
new lock on my specimen box, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Do you really want to go with us?” asked
Jerry, for there had been no time to question the
professor since his excited arrival.</p>

<p>“Of course I do, boys,” he answered.</p>

<p>“But we are going away out West, out in Arizona,
to our gold mine, and perhaps farther&mdash;across
the Rockies.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go wherever you go,” was the answer of
the little bald-headed scientist. “I am searching
for a flying lizard for the museum with which I
am connected, and I may as well look for it in
the Rockies as anywhere else. Go ahead, boys,
I’ll accompany you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry, deciding that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
could question the professor later as to how he
had come to know of their intended trip. “Cast
off, Bob&mdash;Ned.”</p>

<p>“Cast off she is,” responded the two, sailor
fashion, as they again loosened the guy ropes.</p>

<p>“There they go!” shouted the crowd, waving
hands, hats and handkerchiefs, as the motor ship
trembled slightly.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” shouted the parents of the boys.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” chorused the throng.</p>

<p>“Up they go&mdash;to the clouds&mdash;out of sight&mdash;fall
down&mdash;get up again&mdash;fly like the wind&mdash;hit
the moon&mdash;bounce off&mdash;come back&mdash;kill a grizzly
bear&mdash;upside down&mdash;right again&mdash;there they go!”
yelled a shrill voice, and it needed no one to tell
the boys that it was Andy Rush.</p>

<p>The last rope was cast off, and the <i>Comet</i>,
with a rush, went straight up. Jerry, in the
pilot house, pulled over the lever controlling the
motor and the big propellers began to revolve.
The airship darted ahead, sailing over the heads
of the crowd. The motor boys were off for the
west.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>A TOWN IN TROUBLE</small></h2>


<p>For a few minutes after rising in the airship,
the boys were busy adjusting machinery and looking
at various gauges to see that everything was
running smoothly. The <i>Comet</i> had never behaved
better, and was sailing along like a bird.</p>

<p>“Some class to this, eh?” inquired Bob, who,
in addition to his appetite, had another failing&mdash;that
of using slang occasionally.</p>

<p>“She’s running as well as we could expect, and
a little better, considering the treatment she had
at the hands of Noddy Nixon,” responded Jerry.
“I’ll speed her a bit, now.”</p>

<p>He adjusted the lever controlling the motor
and propellers, and the big blades, in front of
the airship, that served to pull it forward, whizzed
around so swiftly that they looked like blurs of
light. Then, fastening the side rudder, so that
the craft would head due west, Jerry left the pilot
house, and joined his companions in the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
cabin, where Professor Snodgrass was busy looking
over his specimens, to ascertain if any had
suffered harm when they escaped from the box
during his rush through the crowd.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to hear we were going
to make another trip, Mr. Snodgrass?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, your father mentioned it in a letter I
had from him a few days ago,” answered the
scientist. “I wrote, as I do, once in a while, to
inquire how you all were, and when he replied
he stated that you were going on a trip West, but
he did not say what for. As it happened, the
museum with which I am now connected, and for
which I travel, collecting specimens, needed a flying
lizard. They are very scarce, and only one
museum that I know of has a specimen. So I
decided to get another. These lizards are supposed
to exist in certain parts of our country, and
I think the west is as likely to contain them as is
any other section. So as soon as I learned you
were going there I hastily packed up, and came
along. But I very nearly missed you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a few minutes more and we would have
been gone,” observed Ned. “But you didn’t bring
your trunk with you, Professor.”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t manage it with my box of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
specimens, spare cases in which to put new specimens
I may get, my net and other things,” and,
truly, it did seem as if the professor could not
have carried another thing, for every pocket
bulged with something, and over his shoulders
and around his waist were strapped boxes and
cases, besides various nets, and other instruments
he used in his capture of insects and reptiles. “I
will buy extra clothing at the first place we stop,”
went on the scientist. “But you boys haven’t yet
told me why you are going West, and your father
didn’t mention it, Bob.”</p>

<p>“We are going out to inspect our mine,” spoke
Jerry quickly, at the same time guardedly motioning
to Bob and Ned not to say anything about
the incident of Jackson Bell, the former hermit.
“We have heard that some one may try to get
possession of it and we want to stop him.” Jerry
decided it would be just as well, for the present,
not to mention the trouble they had had with
Noddy Nixon, and he also resolved to keep silent
regarding the strange mystery they hoped to solve.</p>

<p>“Well, your plans will not be interfered with
by me,” continued Uriah Snodgrass. “I will go
anywhere you do, and look for the flying lizard.”
The professor went on, and told of his hurried
trip to Cresville, that he might join his friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
They talked of former trips, of his pursuit of the
wonderful butterfly in the everglades of Florida,
and of his search for the horned toad in California.</p>

<p>All this while the airship kept on, increasing
her distance from the home of the boys. Jerry
had sent the <i>Comet</i> up about two thousand feet,
and finding favorable currents of air there kept
her in that position. It was an easy matter to go
higher or lower as they desired.</p>

<p>In about an hour, during which time many reminiscences
had been exchanged, Bob exhibited signs
of uneasiness.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Chunky?” inquired Ned.
“Has one of the professor’s pink fleas got inside
your clothes?”</p>

<p>“I sincerely trust not,” said the scientist in apprehension.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that,” replied the stout lad, somewhat
awkwardly. “I&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;I was just
wondering if I hadn’t better go and see about
getting dinner.”</p>

<p>“Dinner? Why, you lobster, it’s only ten
o’clock!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered Bob, “but I’ll have to
start the gasolene stove, and it will take some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
time. I guess I’d better begin. I’ll cook,” he
added, generously.</p>

<p>“Cook! I guess that’s about all you <em>will</em> do
on this trip,” remarked Ned with a laugh, as his
fleshy chum disappeared in the galley. “I never
saw such a chap&mdash;never,” he added.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Professor Snodgrass, trying
to think of some excuse for Bob, “we have to
eat, you know. Even horned toads and flying
lizards eat. And&mdash;one moment I beg of you&mdash;don’t
move, please!” he exclaimed suddenly to
Ned.</p>

<p>“Why not; am I going to fall overboard?”
inquired the lad, in some alarm.</p>

<p>“No, but a new and rare kind of upper-air
mosquito has just alighted on your shoulder,”
spoke the professor, eagerly. “One moment and
I will have it!” He stretched out his hand, containing
a tiny net, and the next moment the insect
was buzzing in it.</p>

<p>“Ah, I have you, little beauty!” exclaimed the
bald-headed man, enthusiastically, and into a
small bottle went the mosquito.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he didn’t bite me,” remarked Ned,
who, just then saw Jerry beckoning to him from
the pilot house. When the two chums were together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Jerry cautioned Ned about speaking of
the possible solution of the mystery connected
with Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything about it to the professor,”
said Jerry. “We’ll wait until we get to the mine,
and see how matters develop there. It may be
that there is nothing to this, and that we are on
the wrong track about Mr. Bell,” but it was not
long before Jerry was to learn that there was even
more in the mystery than he suspected. “Tell
Bob,” he went on to Ned. “Then you can help
him with grub. I’m beginning to feel a little
hungry myself.”</p>

<p>The meal was served at noon, about a mile
high in the air, with the <i>Comet</i> shooting along at
the rate of fifty miles an hour, for the wind was
favorable.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem so much of a novelty now,”
remarked Bob, munching a sandwich, and looking
down at the green earth spread out below him.
“I remember the first trip we made I was a little
nervous.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was the time when the professor nearly
fell overboard trying to capture a queer insect,”
said Jerry. “Don’t do anything like that
again, please, Mr. Snodgrass,” he added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll not,” agreed the scientist, who was trying
to eat, and at the same time enter in his note book
some observations about insects of the upper air.</p>

<p>Until the middle of the afternoon, the travelers
flew along, high in the air. About three o’clock,
when Ned was steering in the pilot house, there
came a sudden gust of wind that heeled the airship
over at a sharp angle.</p>

<p>“Quick! Try the lower currents!” called Jerry,
from the engine room. “It may be quieter down
near the earth.”</p>

<p>Ned shifted the deflecting rudder, and the
<i>Comet</i> shot earthward on a long slant. As Jerry
had predicted, it was more quiet there, the wind
blowing gently.</p>

<p>Their course was now southwest, and, judging
by the speed and the length of time they had
been in motion, they figured that the airship was
over Pennsylvania. As it raced along, about five
hundred feet above the surface, and over a rather
sparsely settled country, Bob, who was looking
through a telescope, suddenly uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why there’s a big crowd just ahead there,”
replied the fat lad. “About two thousand people
on the bank of a river. It looks as if something
had happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe some one has fallen in,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“Speed her up, and we’ll soon find out,” directed
Jerry, and Ned yanked over the propeller
lever.</p>

<p>As the airship came nearer, it could be seen
that there were two good-sized towns, one on
either side of a swiftly flowing river, that appeared
to be swollen from floods. Gathered on
the banks of the stream were two large crowds,
and they appeared to be signalling to each other.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s happened?” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon find out,” answered Jerry. “Go a
bit slower.”</p>

<p>“There’s trouble of some kind; that’s sure,”
was the opinion of Professor Snodgrass. “The
people in the larger town seem to be in distress.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than from the midst
of the larger crowd there came a flash of fire, and
a volume of white smoke rolled out. Then came
a dull boom.</p>

<p>“They’re firing! Firing a cannon!” cried Bob.
“The people on one side of the river are shooting
at those on the other side! What can be the
matter?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>NEW USE FOR AN AIRSHIP</small></h2>


<p>Indeed it did seem as if a miniature battle was
in progress, but the people fired at did not appear
to be in any fear. There was only a slight
movement among them, though the boys and the
professor in the airship could plainly see a black
object, which they took to be a cannon ball, speeding
across the wide, turgid, rushing river. But
the projectile fell short, and landed about twenty
feet from shore, splashing the water high.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a flash of flame and a
puff of smoke from the other side of the stream,
and the fire was returned, another black object
speeding toward the crowd that had first discharged
a cannon.</p>

<p>“It’s a regular battle!” cried the professor.
“Don’t go any lower, boys. They may fire on
us!”</p>

<p>But Jerry, Ned and Bob were too interested
in the curious fight going on below them, to want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to steer out of the way. The airship was slowed
up, and hovered over the queer scene.</p>

<p>“The second projectile fell short, too,” remarked
Ned, as he saw it splash into the water,
twenty-five feet from the western shore. “Why
don’t they put in more powder if they want ’em
to reach across?”</p>

<p>“But why are they firing at each other, anyhow?”
questioned Bob, too interested, for the
time being, to think of eating. “Two towns can’t
be at war with one another.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see what it is,” said Jerry. “They
are getting ready to fire again.”</p>

<p>Indeed preparations could be noticed among
the group of men surrounding a small brass cannon.
But, just as they were loading it several in
the crowd uttered cries of astonishment, and
pointed upward. Instantly the two throngs on
either side of the river seemed to forget their
animosity toward one another, and began making
excited motions to those in the airship.</p>

<p>“They evidently want us to come down,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it,” urged the professor. “They
only want something else to shoot at. They may
elevate their cannon any minute and fire upon
us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” was Jerry’s opinion.
“There’s something queer going on, and I want
to find out what it is.”</p>

<p>The people continued to make motions to the
boys, as if urging them to land. They were apparently
calling out something, but the height at
which the <i>Comet</i> was precluded the voices being
heard distinctly, and Jerry, anxious as he was to
learn the cause for the shooting, was not quite
ready to descend.</p>

<p>Finally one man on the ground improvised a
megaphone out of some newspapers, and pointing
it at the airship yelled:</p>

<p>“Come down and help us! The bridge has
washed away!”</p>

<p>“The bridge has washed away!” repeated Bob.
“Well, what can we do? And why should they
fire at one another, unless some one in either
crowd cut the bridge loose, and started a fight?”</p>

<p>“The high water probably carried the bridge
away,” said Jerry. “What we can do for them
I don’t see. However, we’ll go down. Don’t
you think we might venture, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the scientist slowly, “seeing
that they have invited us, they will hardly fire on
us now. Besides, I might possibly find the flying
lizard there. Yes, go down, by all means.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later, while the crowds on either
side of the stream looked on in wonder, Jerry
brought the airship to earth, on the western shore.
The craft was immediately surrounded by an excited
throng.</p>

<p>“You’re just in time!” cried one man, the same
one who had used the megaphone. “We’ve tried
everything we could&mdash;kites, swimmers, rats, and
even the cannon&mdash;but nothing seems to do any
good.”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do?” asked Jerry,
much puzzled, as, indeed, were his chums.</p>

<p>“Get a line across to the other shore, to establish
communication,” replied the man. “You see,
our town and the other one were connected by
a bridge. This is Wakedell, on this side, and
Eaton on the other side of the river. Lots of
our people work in factories in Eaton, but since
the bridge washed away, day before yesterday,
there is no way of getting across.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got any boats?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, we had several, and when the bridge
washed down stream we got them out. But the
current is so swift, and there are so many rocks
in the river that it’s dangerous. Besides, if we
start a boat on this side, and head it for Eaton,
it’s likely to bring up a mile down on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
side, in a patch of lonesome woods. Then several
boats upset, and were lost, and we barely
saved the people.</p>

<p>“So we decided to try a new plan. We knew
if we could get a strong wire cable from shore
to shore we could run boats across by means of
that, and with little danger, until we got a new
bridge built, or until the water went down. You
see, there are a lot of people who live here caught
on the other side, and we have a lot of Eaton
folks here, who want to get home, but can’t, as
there’s no other bridge standing on this river
now, within fifty miles; all washed away.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you get the cable over?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the man. “As I said, we’ve tried
everything. We tried to get a rope across by
flying a kite, but the wind wasn’t right. Then we
tried tying a light string to a big muskrat, and
threw him as far across as we could, thinking he
would swim to the other side, but the rat swam
right back here. The folks on the other side
have tried to get a line to us, but couldn’t. One
man tried to swim over, but it was too dangerous,
and he had to turn back. We even tried a toy
balloon, and did manage to get a light cord over.
But when we tried to pull over a heavier one, the
light cord broke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we thought of the cannon. We each
had one, for Fourth of July celebrations, and we
took turns firing. We used pieces of iron for
projectiles, and tied cords to them, thinking we
could shoot them across the river.”</p>

<p>“You don’t use enough powder,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, we did at first,” replied the man. “We
put in heavy enough charges, but they blew the
cords off the projectiles, and we were as badly off
as before. Then we reduced the charge, but the
pieces of iron fall short every time. We were
about to give up, when we saw your airship. Then
I thought of a plan.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Could you carry a rope over the river for
us?” asked the man eagerly. “If you will, we
can soon haul a wire cable across, and fasten it
firmly on either shore. Then we can run a big
flat-bottom boat back and forth until the bridge
is built. That’s the only way I see, so folks from
Eaton can get here, and so we can get over there.
Things are in a bad way. Husbands are separated
from their wives, and the factories are short
of hands. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“Of course we will!” cried Jerry heartily. “It’s
a new use for an airship, but I guess it’s a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
one. Get the rope and we’ll fly across with it in
quick time.”</p>

<p>“I hoped you would,” spoke the man earnestly.
“It was the last chance I saw. Hurrah, folks!”
he shouted. “The airship will take a rope across
for us. No need to fire the cannon any more,”
and there was set up a cheer, which was echoed
from the throng on the other bank, nearly a
mile away, for the people there understood that
relief measures were under way.</p>

<p>“Get busy, boys,” said Jerry to his chums.
“This is a new job for us, but I guess we can do
it.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>RUNNING THE CABLE</small></h2>


<p>The hopelessness of the crowds on both sides
of the river had now changed to joyful anticipation.
They had seen so many attempts fail to
establish communication that they had almost
given up. Of course they knew that in time the
river would go down, and transit across it in
boats would be comparatively easy. But it would
still be several days before the waters would subside,
it was stated, because the river was fed from
many mountain brooks and rivulets, which were
much swollen by heavy rains.</p>

<p>“And even if the river does get to its normal
level,” explained the man with the megaphone,
who introduced himself as James Duncan, “even
then it’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Because of a number of rocks, and the rapids
which are in this part of the stream. A bridge
is the only safe way to cross, and it will be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
time before that can be rebuilt. But the steel
cable ferry will be a big help. Are you ready
to take it over now?”</p>

<p>“As soon as you are,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“I think we had better carry a rope over first,”
decided Jerry. “Then your friends on the other
side can haul the cable over. If we attempt to
carry the heavy wire rope in the airship it may
sag, or foul, and do some damage. But we can
carry a stout rope across very easily.”</p>

<p>“We have the rope right here,” explained Mr.
Duncan. “Come on, gentlemen,” he called to
some of his friends. “Get the rope ready. The
boys are going to take it across. Then the boat
will begin running.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried scores of voices.</p>

<p>Jerry, Ned and Bob now re-entered the airship,
and began to prepare for running the cable. They
looked to the motors, and set the gas machine in
operation, to fully distend the big bag, as they
needed all the reserve buoyancy, since the long
rope would be a heavy drag.</p>

<p>“Here you are!” called Mr. Duncan, passing
up the end of a rope, about an inch in diameter.
“Better fasten it well, for a rope a mile long is
rather heavy.”</p>

<p>Jerry saw that it was securely attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
strong braces in the after part of the <i>Comet</i>, and
then he requested Mr. Duncan to see to it that
the rope was paid out well from the shore.</p>

<p>“I’ll station a man right near it, to see that it
does not tangle,” promised Mr. Duncan, who
seemed to be in general charge of matters. “Here,
Mr. Simon,” he called to a very stout individual,
“you keep near this coil of rope and see that it
doesn’t snarl. I’m going to get the wire cable
ready, and see to the boat.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That man might be a cousin to
Chunky,” observed Ned in a low voice, as he
noted the rope custodian.</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it out,” pleaded Bob, who was sensitive
about his fleshiness.</p>

<p>“Where’s the professor?” asked Jerry, suddenly,
looking about. “I haven’t seen him for
five minutes.”</p>

<p>The boys looked over the crowd. Most of the
people were thronged about the airship, inspecting
it, but, off to one side there was a little group,
which seemed strangely agitated. Then there
came an excited exclamation, and a long handled
net was thrust upward.</p>

<p>“There’s the professor,” observed Bob. “Probably
he’s capturing a slab-sided mud turtle, or
some other queer creature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“We can come back for him,” remarked Ned.
“He’ll be better satisfied to stay here and catch
bugs than come with us while we’re running the
cable.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” agreed Jerry. A few minutes
later, as everything was in readiness, the signal
to start was given. The anchor ropes that had
held down the <i>Comet</i> were cast off, and the big
craft shot up into the air, dragging the rope after
it. Jerry headed it straight across the river, and
soon they were directly above the turbulent stream,
which boiled and bubbled over the hidden rocks.</p>

<p>“Ned, you watch the rope being paid out,” directed
Jerry. “I’ll steer, and Bob can go to the
motor room.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” asked the stout youth rather
dubiously, for Chunky was not very fond of
machinery, and a motorcycle or an automobile was
about his limit.</p>

<p>“You shut off power when I tell you to,” responded
Jerry. “Something may happen and
then we’ll want to stop suddenly.”</p>

<p>They were not moving very swiftly for the
heavy rope acted as a drag, and besides, Jerry had
not turned on full power, as he wanted no accidents
to occur. But they crossed the river without
accident, pulling over the rope. When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
landing was made on the eastern shore, scores
crowded up around the craft, almost overwhelming
our heroes with their thanks, and all eager to
see the airship.</p>

<p>“Here, never mind looking at that circus machine,”
called one man, good naturedly. “Let’s
get busy and pull the wire rope over. I want to
see the ferry running. I haven’t been home in
two days, and I don’t know what my wife and
children look like,” and he laughed, for the first
time in many hours, he told the boys.</p>

<p>It was a comparatively easy matter, now that
a large rope was stretched across the river, to
haul over the wire cable. This was soon made
fast to anchorages, and then, to guard against
accidents, an additional cable was strung, for fear
the first might break. A broad, flat-bottomed boat
was in readiness, and it was so arranged that it
could be pulled along by means of the cable and
a windlass, worked by two men, the craft being
prevented from going down stream by the heavy
cable.</p>

<p>The ferry was soon in operation, and the boys
watched the first boat load of people being transferred.
It worked well, and the lads were overwhelmed
with thanks. Some persons even offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
them money, but of course our friends would not
take it.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well be on our way again,
I suppose,” remarked Jerry, after they had
watched the boat go back and forth several times.</p>

<p>“We might send telegrams home before we
leave,” went on Bob, “and let the folks know we
have gotten this far in safety. There must be
a telegraph office around here.”</p>

<p>“It is a good idea,” commented Jerry. “Glad
you mentioned it, Bob. We’ll send word home.”</p>

<p>They inquired the location of the telegraph
office, and, as it was in the centre of town, Ned
and Bob remained with the airship, while Jerry
took the dispatches.</p>

<p>The telegraph office was in the railroad station,
and while Jerry stood on the platform, chatting
with the agent, a freight train rumbled in,
and stopped, while the engine got water at a distant
tank.</p>

<p>Jerry, having accomplished his errand, was
about to turn away, to go back to his chums, when,
from the shadows of a freight car that was on a
siding, he observed a man run quickly out, and
cling to the break-beams of one of the refrigerator
cars of the freight.</p>

<p>“Some tramp going to steal a ride,” reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the lad, but, just then, the gleam from a switch
lamp, for it was now getting dusk, fell upon the
tramp’s face. Jerry started and could hardly
repress an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Bill Berry!” he murmured to himself. “Bill
Berry, that town good-for-nothing&mdash;that crony of
Noddy’s! What can he be doing here? I wonder
if he is following us?” For Bill Berry, as
my readers know, had, more than once, been the
cause of much trouble to the motor boys.</p>

<p>Bill was now out of sight under the car, well
hidden from view. Jerry first thought he would
speak to the agent about it, and then he reflected
that this would do little good.</p>

<p>“Where is that freight bound for?” he asked,
as carelessly as he could.</p>

<p>“That? Oh, that’s a through freight for the
West,” answered the telegraph operator. “It goes
right through to California, just as it is. Right
across the Rockies.”</p>

<p>Jerry could not repress a start.</p>

<p>“Across the Rockies,” he thought. “And that’s
where we’re bound! Noddy Nixon has already
gone out there, and Bill Berry will probably join
him. Then there’ll be trouble for us!”</p>

<p>With apprehension in his heart Jerry turned to
go back to the airship.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR IS MISSING</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry?” asked Ned, as
soon as the tall lad had joined his chums. The
lights had been set aglow in the cabin of the airship,
and around the craft was gathered a curious
throng.</p>

<p>“Why?” replied Jerry. “Does anything look
to be the matter?” and he tried to speak lightly.</p>

<p>“You look as if you had seen a ghost,” answered
Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I did; sort of one,” was Jerry’s sober
answer. “I saw Bill Berry, and he’s worse than
a ghost.”</p>

<p>“Bill Berry!” exclaimed Ned and Bob in the
same breath. “Where?”</p>

<p>“Under a freight car.”</p>

<p>“Was he dead?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“So that’s why you thought him a ghost?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t dead,” returned Jerry. “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was very much alive, and he was on the through
western freight, on his way to join Noddy and
the others of the gang, I suppose. Boys, we’ll
have to hustle to get ahead of them.”</p>

<p>A little later, after warning the throng to stand
back, Jerry entered the pilot house, and, lighting
the big search lamp, started the motor. The ship
arose, and the great propellers began to revolve.</p>

<p>“Good-bye! Good-bye!” shouted the people,
and they cheered the boys who had been of such
service to them.</p>

<p>The lads answered with farewells, and then,
with Bob and Ned in the cabin, the former getting
ready to cook supper, and Jerry in the pilot house,
the <i>Comet</i> was sent due west, as straight as the
compass indicated.</p>

<p>Bob had just announced that “grub” was ready,
and Jerry was about to adjust the automatic steering
apparatus, so that he could leave the airship
to itself, while he ate, when Ned uttered an exclamation
of dismay.</p>

<p>“The professor!” he cried. “Professor Snodgrass!
We have left him behind!”</p>

<p>For a moment the three stared blankly at one
another. Then the truth dawned upon them. The
scientist had resumed his fad of collecting insects
as soon as he was out of the airship, and, the excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of getting the cable across the river, and
Jerry’s sight of Bill Berry, had driven all thoughts
of their friend from their minds.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” gasped Jerry.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that put mustard on your egg sandwich!”
exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” asked Ned, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“Done? Why we’ve got to go back after him,
of course,” was Jerry’s rejoinder. “I wonder if
we can find the place in the darkness?”</p>

<p>It was rather a risk, but, fortunately they had
not gone far, and the lights of the town they had
left were quite brilliant. Then, too, there was
no other place near it, save the one across the
river, and this was easily distinguished.</p>

<p>Soon they were skimming back, and in a little
while they had landed on the outskirts of Wakedell.</p>

<p>“You two had better stay here with the airship,
and I’ll go in town and see if I can find the
professor,” said Jerry. “I don’t believe I’ll
have much trouble in locating him.”</p>

<p>The tall lad was soon on his way through the
principal street of the city. He was at once recognized
as one of the boys from the airship, and
was cordially greeted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“The professor&mdash;that little bald-headed man?”
repeated several, when Jerry had questioned
them. “No, we haven’t seen him. But then
we’ve been so busy since the ferry started to run,
that there’s nothing uncommon in that. I say,
but you lads did us a good service.”</p>

<p>“But what can have become of the professor?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’d better see Mr. Duncan,” was the
advice given. “He’s chairman of the board of
aldermen, and he knows everything in this burg.
See Mr. Duncan.”</p>

<p>Jerry sought out the man who had superintended
the stringing of the cable.</p>

<p>“The professor?” he repeated. “Well, I
think the most likely place to look for him would
be at the hotel. There is only one in the place,
and, very likely, when he found you had gone off
and left him, he went there. We’ll go and make
inquiries.”</p>

<p>“How is the ferry running?” asked Jerry, more
to show a polite interest than for any other reason,
for he was somewhat worried over many
matters, not the least of which was the absence
of Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Fine!” replied Mr. Duncan. “Couldn’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
better! But here we are at the hotel, where, I
have no doubt, you will find your friend.”</p>

<p>Jerry, accompanied by Mr. Duncan, entered
the corridor. The lad inquired if Professor
Snodgrass had put up there.</p>

<p>“You mean a little man, with not much hair
on his head,” asked the clerk, “who’s always
looking around as if he’d lost something?”</p>

<p>“That’s the gentleman,” replied Jerry, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“He’s in room sixteen. Front!” cried the
clerk, and when a bell boy responded, the man
back of the desk added: “Show Mr. Duncan and
his friend up to sixteen.”</p>

<p>As Jerry and Mr. Duncan advanced along the
corridor, led by the bell boy, they were met by
a chambermaid, who was rushing wildly along.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Mary?” asked the bell
boy.</p>

<p>“Matter? Sure there’s a crazy man in number
sixteen!” was the answer. “He’s beating
down the walls! I’m going to tell the boss!” and
she disappeared on the run.</p>

<p>Jerry, Mr. Duncan and the bell boy hurried
on. As they came in front of room number sixteen
they heard a violent pounding on the walls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Certainly it did seem as if some one was trying
to batter his way out.</p>

<p>“That’s can’t be the professor,” remarked
Jerry. “He wouldn’t act that way.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has been attacked by a robber!”
suggested Mr. Duncan. “Run, my lad, and get
help,” he added to the bell boy, whose small face
contrasted strangely with his large eyes.</p>

<p>Once more there came a violent pounding on
the wall, so that the floors seemed to shake.</p>

<p>“If that is the professor, perhaps he has been
bitten by one of his snakes, toads or queer insects,
and has gone crazy,” thought Jerry. Then,
as the racket continued, he heard above the noise,
a voice calling:</p>

<p>“Come down! Come down off that wall or
I’ll get a ladder and catch you! Come down,
I say!” Then the pounding started again, just as
the bell boy returned, with the clerk and several
janitors.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> the professor,” murmured Jerry, who
did not know what to think. “But he must be in
great distress!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>AT THE MINING CAMP</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter? What’s the trouble?”
cried the hotel clerk, running up.</p>

<p>“Aw, dere’s a guy in dere what’s got bats in
his belfrey, boss,” explained the bell boy, in his
choicest slang. “He’s a bug-house.”</p>

<p>“Is he a friend of yours?” asked the clerk of
Jerry.</p>

<p>“If it’s Professor Snodgrass, he is,” replied the
lad, “but I can’t imagine what makes him act so,”
for the pounding on the walls continued.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon see!” exclaimed the clerk.
“Here, Jim, you and Jack break down that door,
and stand ready to grab the lunatic. He’ll smash
the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better to see if the door is
locked, before smashing it in?” suggested Mr.
Duncan. “You may alarm the unfortunate man
unnecessarily if you break it down.”</p>

<p>“I’ll open it,” said Jerry, eagerly, and he tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the knob. It turned readily and Jerry stepped
into the room. The others followed timidly but
they need have had no fears. For, no sooner had
Jerry stepped over the threshold than the professor,
for it was the scientist in the room, cried
out:</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry, I’m so glad you’ve come. Help
me to get him! I can’t reach him!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the lad, looking about,
and noting that nothing in the room had been
disturbed, in spite of the terrific racket.</p>

<p>“It’s a new kind of water bug,” explained the
professor. “One with red stripes down his back.
I must get the specimen, but it is so high up on
the wall that I can’t reach it, even by standing
on a chair. I tried to jar it down, by pounding
on the walls, but the little beauty is still there.
See, there he is!” and Mr. Snodgrass pointed to
a curious insect high upon the wall.</p>

<p>“Was that what made the pounding?” demanded
the hotel clerk, evidently much chagrined.</p>

<p>“It was, my dear sir,” replied the professor
calmly. “I knocked as softly as I could, yet I
felt I must have that bug. It is worth a hundred
dollars at least.”</p>

<p>“Say, the hotel’s full of ’em,” murmured the
bell boy. “I’ll catch you a dozen for a quarter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, but they have no red stripes down their
backs,” declared the scientist. “Help me get this
one, Jerry.”</p>

<p>Jerry said little. In fact there was not much
he could say. The professor gazed calmly at the
crowd that had entered his room. Then he inquired
mildly:</p>

<p>“Has there been a fire, or anything like that?”</p>

<p>“No, only a little excitement,” responded Mr.
Duncan, trying not to smile. “Are you all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Why shouldn’t I be?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” murmured Mr. Duncan, turning
aside.</p>

<p>Jerry got on a chair, and, being tall, soon had
the red-striped water bug, which the professor
carefully put in his specimen box. Then, as the
janitors, clerk, bell boy and chambermaid withdrew,
the professor remarked:</p>

<p>“When I left the airship I saw a rare specimen
of a Buffalo bug-moth on a lady in the crowd.
I captured that and then I saw several other valuable
specimens. I was so busy making a collection,
for this is a wonderful town for bugs, that,
before I knew it, night had fallen. I inquired
my way to the hotel, and I knew you would find
me as soon as the cable was strung. Isn’t it nearly
done, Jerry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all finished,” replied the lad. “We had
started off without you, when we suddenly remembered
that you were not with us, and we
came back. Then the chambermaid said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jerry paused, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Yes, what did she say?” asked the professor,
innocently. “Did she know of any more of these
bugs?”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” finished Jerry. “But I came
back to get you, professor.” He did not mention
the alarm the scientist had innocently caused.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t have been in any hurry. I
was enjoying myself here. I never saw so many
rare bugs in one town before, in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Well, are you ready to go on with us?” inquired
the tall lad.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I suppose so. I must soon begin to
search for my flying lizard amid the mountains.
Yes, I am ready to go.”</p>

<p>Looking carefully to see that he still had the
red-striped water bug, the professor gathered up
his belongings, and, after paying his small hotel
bill, left with Jerry.</p>

<p>Once more they started off, and all that night
the <i>Comet</i> made good time, skimming along just
beneath the clouds. The next two days were devoid
of incident, and they covered a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
miles. Occasionally, in the next week, they descended
to replenish their supply of gasolene and
oil, or to buy fresh provisions. The ship was
behaving admirably, and they expected, in about
three days more, to reach their destination. They
had telegraphed Jim Nestor, the veteran miner,
that they would soon be with him.</p>

<p>They reached the first range of the Rockies
late one afternoon, and that night began their
flight across them.</p>

<p>“Just think of it, boys,” announced Jerry.
“We’ll soon be over Pike’s Peak!”</p>

<p>“If nothing happens,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>They recalled the remark of the stout lad the
next day, when, as they were sailing along over a
high range, there came a sudden snap, and one
of the planes that had been damaged when Noddy
had run away with the car, broke.</p>

<p>Instantly the <i>Comet</i> began to fall, since the gas
bag was not filled to the usual capacity.</p>

<p>“We’re going down!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“Keep cool,” advised Jerry, as he shut off the
power. “I think I can glide down safely.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t I start the gas machine?” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jerry. “Maybe we can make
enough to bear us up before we hit anything
solid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>But the vapor could not be generated fast
enough to do any good, and it looked as if the
<i>Comet</i> was going to strike the earth with force
enough to demolish it. Jerry, however, kept his
head, and, by the skillful use of the deflecting
rudder he threw up the head of the craft so that,
striking a heavy strata of air, the ship slid down
on it, like a sled upon the ice. The craft came to
the ground with considerable force, but the improved
springs in the starting wheels took up
most of the shock, and the boys suffered no more
than a severe jolt.</p>

<p>“Well, we came down out of that fairly well,”
remarked Jerry, with a sigh of relief. “Now
we’ll see if we can fix things.”</p>

<p>“Guess we’d better wait until morning,” suggested
Ned, after a glance at the broken plane.
“We’ll have to cut a new frame for it.”</p>

<p>Jerry agreed with this, and, after tying the
craft securely, to prevent it being blown away
during a high wind, the boys prepared to spend
the night on top of one of the higher ranges of
the Rockies. They were undisturbed, save for
the far-off howls of some big mountain lions.</p>

<p>They set to work in the morning, and, by
dint of hard work, had the repairs made by noon.
Then, at Ned’s earnest request they did go on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
mountain lion hunt. But the lions seemed to
prefer darkness to daylight, and the only one seen
was a small specimen, which Ned killed after
three shots. He wanted to save the skin of it,
but his chums persuaded him that he could get
larger and better specimens where they were going.
As usual, the professor began a search for
insects as soon as the landing was made, and
he kept it up until they were ready to start.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t get my flying lizard,” he complained.
“Still, I have hopes.”</p>

<p>They started again, early the next morning,
and Jerry set the motor at a good speed to make
up for lost time. Toward evening, of the second
day, when they had crossed the extreme end of a
range known as the Magollon Mountains, and
were sailing over a wide valley, Bob suddenly
called out:</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that place look familiar, down
there?” He pointed to a small settlement. Jerry
seized the telescope from his chum, and applied
it to his eye.</p>

<p>“It does!” he announced excitedly. “That’s
the settlement near our mine. We ought to sight
our diggings in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Go lower down,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry shifted the deflecting rudder, and, a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
later, the <i>Comet</i> was nearing the earth.
There could now be observed numbers of miners
running about, and pointing upward. Nearer and
nearer to the earth came the airship. Then Ned
cried:</p>

<p>“There it is! There’s the place. I see the hut
we used to live in, when we opened the mine!
Hurrah! We’re here at last, fellows!”</p>

<p>“And ready to solve the mystery of the valley,”
added Jerry in a low voice.</p>

<p>“There’s some one waving at you,” remarked
the professor, pointing to a man who was vigorously
swinging his hat.</p>

<p>“Jim! It’s old Jim Nestor!” cried Bob, who
had good eyes. “Jim is waiting for us!”</p>

<p>Down glided the airship. She was at the end
of the first part of her trip. But a harder voyage
was yet ahead of her and the boys.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE MINER’S STORY</small></h2>


<p>“Well, you got here at last, did you?” called
Jim Nestor, as he came forward to greet the boys
and the professor as they alighted from the airship.
“We’ve been sort of sightin’ for ye the
last few hours. I calculated you’d be along about
now, but Sledge Hammer Tod, here, he allowed
as how you wouldn’t show up for a week, and
maybe not at all, for he don’t believe in airships;
do you, Tod?” and Jim looked at an old miner
who shuffled up with him.</p>

<p>“Never havin’ seen one, I put ’em in the same
class with Santa Claus,” answered the miner.
“But I believe in ’em now.”</p>

<p>He glanced with wondering eyes at the big
airship, which had settled down on a level spot
in front of the group of buildings that were
around the shaft of the boys’ gold mine.</p>

<p>“Boys, let me introduce to you my friend, Mr.
Embury Tod&mdash;Sledge Hammer Tod, I call him,
for he hammers away at things, and there isn’t a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
better miner going. Tod, these are the boys I
was telling you of.”</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you,” spoke the old miner,
with a friendly nod. “And so that’s the airship,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Airship or motor ship, as we sometimes call
it,” replied Jerry. “We came all the way from
the East in it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” exclaimed Sledge Hammer
Tod. “That’s going some.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of Noddy Nixon or
his gang?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t want to,” replied Jim Nestor.
“I received your letters and telegrams, saying
he might make trouble, but he hasn’t showed
up here yet, but when he does, why, Tod and I
are ready for him, aren’t we, Sledge Hammer?”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” and the old miner, who was
several years the senior of Nestor, clenched a
brawny fist.</p>

<p>“Tod’s my new foreman,” went on Jim. “The
work got so heavy I had to have help.”</p>

<p>“Then the mine’s doing well?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s face showed the relief he felt. “Well,
what kind of a trip did you have?” went on
Nestor. “Land sakes, I never see such boys!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
First you come all the way out here in an auto,
and locate a mine I thought was as good as gone.
Then you come in an airship. Next I s’pose you’ll
be growing wings, and flying without any apparatus
whatever.”</p>

<p>“Hardly, yet awhile,” commented Jerry, who
then went into detail about the trip, telling of
Noddy’s theft of the airship, and how they had
stopped on their way to carry the cable across
the river.</p>

<p>“But the funny part of it was,” went on Jerry,
“that when Noddy stole our airship, we have
every reason to believe that there was with him
an old man, who you will remember, Jim. He
was Jackson&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that moment Professor Snodgrass fairly
jumped toward Tod.</p>

<p>“Excuse me!” exclaimed the scientist. “Don’t
move an inch, I beg of you! It’s very important.
Don’t stir!”</p>

<p>“If it’s a rattlesnake, jest stomp on its head,”
said the miner, coolly. “I’m not afraid of ’em.
Where is it?” and he prepared to turn around.</p>

<p>“Quiet! Quiet!” begged the little bald-headed
man. “I will have it in a second,” and he made
a dive for the miner’s boot. “There!” exclaimed
the professor, “I have it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>He arose, holding something tightly in his
hand, and he quickly transferred it to his green
specimen box, at the same time remarking:</p>

<p>“That certainly was a beauty; worth at least
fifty dollars at the lowest calculation!”</p>

<p>The old miner looked at the professor, and then
at the boys. Then he pointed significantly to his
head. The scientist did not see him.</p>

<p>“What did you capture that time?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“A rare specimen of a jumping fly,” was the
answer. “It is the first one I have ever seen,”
and the scientist began to jot down in his book
some notes concerning it.</p>

<p>“He isn’t crazy, Sledge Hammer,” declared
Jim Nestor, in a whisper, for he knew what his
foreman thought. “He jest collects bugs, that’s
all,” and, while Professor Snodgrass moved off
to one side, to look for more jumping flies, the
boys explained the fad of their friend.</p>

<p>“But you started to say something about a Mr.
Jackson,” remarked Jim Nestor, to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not Mr. Jackson, but Jackson Bell, the old
hermit,” was the answer, and Jerry proceeded to
explain as much of the mystery as he knew; how
he believed that Mr. Bell had come East to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
aid in rescuing some of his friends from a mysterious
valley, how he had been deceived by
Noddy, taken in the airship, and how he disappeared,
leaving the fragments of a letter behind
him.</p>

<p>“I wish we could find him,” went on Jerry,
“and aid his friends. But, after thinkin’ it all
over, I am sometimes inclined to believe that Mr.
Bell’s mind may have become weakened, and that
he imagined all that about his friends being in
danger in some valley.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” assented Nestor. “I guess
there’s not much stock to be taken in it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is!” suddenly exclaimed the old
miner.</p>

<p>“Is what?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“Stock to be taken in that story,” answered
Tod. “I don’t know this Mr. Jackson Bell, but
I do happen to know that somewhere in the Rocky
Mountains is a mysterious valley, where there is
supposed to be a party of whites&mdash;men, women
and children&mdash;who have been lost for years.”</p>

<p>“You know something like that, and never told
me?” asked Nestor, somewhat reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you never asked me,” went on Tod,
“and, for that matter, the story is an old one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell it to us,” begged Jerry, eagerly, believing
that they had unexpectedly gotten on the track
of the mystery.</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t much to tell, or, rather, I
don’t know an awful lot about it,” resumed Tod.
“It happened a number of years ago. A party
of Easterners who got tired of the life in cities
decided to come out West. They heard of a
place where some good gold claims could be had,
nothing remarkable, you know, but sufficient to
attract them. They planned to come together,
take up claims, build a little settlement and live
there the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>“Well, they started out, and they got to the
mountains. Men I’ve known, who have been
prospecting since forty-nine remember to have
met the party on their travels. As I said, they
had nearly reached their diggings when they suddenly
disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Where to?” asked Bob, who, like his companions,
was greatly interested.</p>

<p>“That’s the mystery of it,” answered Tod.
“No one knew where they went to. The last seen
of them was that they were being led up into the
Uncompahgre mountains in Colorado, and an
Indian was their guide. Some old prospectors
seen ’em, and they thought it was rather risky for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to trust an Indian, but they didn’t say nothin’, for
folks out here get in the habit of mindin’ their
own business. Anyway, that was the last seen of
the party of white folks. As I said, there were
men, women and children, though the children
must be growed up now.”</p>

<p>“How many of them were there?” asked Bob
softly.</p>

<p>“About two score, I reckon, though if they’re
alive now I don’t s’pose there’s so many, for some
must have died, as they were old men. Anyhow
that’s the story of the missing party. They were
called the ‘Deering Band,’ as they were led by a
man named Deering. I don’t s’pose they will
ever be located, but it’s true, what your friend
Jackson Bell intimated, that there is a mystery
about them. Though how Bell came to know of
them, and why he started to rescue them is more
than I can figure. But Deering and his crowd
seem to have disappeared from the face of the
earth. Maybe the Indians killed them all.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we always thought,” spoke a
voice at the side of Sledge Hammer Tod. It
came so suddenly that everyone gave a start, until
it was seen that it was Professor Snodgrass who
had made the remark.</p>

<p>“Do you know the story of the missing Deering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Band?” asked Jerry. “We did not speak to you
about this mystery, Professor, as we did not want
to take your mind off your work.”</p>

<p>“Know about it? Of course, I know about it,”
was the unexpected reply. “Amos Deering, the
leader, was my cousin!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>NODDY NIXON ARRIVES</small></h2>


<p>The unexpected announcement of Professor
Snodgrass came as a startling confirmation to the
story told by the old miner. The scientist, having
finished making an entry in his note-book, had
come up, and listened to the recital. All eyes
were now turned on him.</p>

<p>“Was Amos Deering your cousin?” asked
Sledge Hammer Tod, thinking he might not have
heard aright; then, too, he was not quite satisfied
as to the perfect sanity of the bald-headed man.</p>

<p>“He was,” replied the scientist. “Amos was
always fond of a roving life, and when he heard
of a place out West where he could take up some
gold claims, he organized a party to go with him.
It was in the year that I discovered a five-legged
frog, and wrote a book about it. Amos wanted
me to go with the party, saying I could find many
specimens if I did not want to hunt for gold. But
I declined. However, he and a number of venturesome
persons went. We waited in vain for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
some news, and at last it came. It was to the
effect that the entire party had been led off into
the mountains by the Indians, and killed. Poor
Amos, to think I should meet somebody out here
who knew of him!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s true that the party was led off to
the mountains, and by the Indians,” said Tod,
“but it’s not altogether so sure that they were
killed. Maybe some are living yet, though where
they are is a mystery.”</p>

<p>“From the clews left by Mr. Bell, it would
seem that they are alive,” suggested Jerry. “Mr.
Bell practically says the party is alive, and in his
letter to his son, the torn parts of which epistle
I found in the airship, he says he is about to go
to their rescue. They are in some sort of a
valley, I take it, hard to get at. That’s why Mr.
Bell thought of an airship, and why he started to
find us, but, instead, met with Noddy Nixon.
Now, the question is, can we find that valley?”</p>

<p>Sledge Hammer Tod shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Lost Valley it’s called,” he said. “Many
have tried to find it, but have failed&mdash;miners of
experience&mdash;for there is a rumor that gold is
plentiful in it. And, not only is it hard to find,
but there is danger from the Indians.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought all the Indians were on Government
reservations,” commented Bob.</p>

<p>“Not all,” answered Tod. “Some broke away,
and are still in the Colorado mountains, I believe.
Perhaps the remnant of this tribe is in possession
of Lost Valley. Anyhow, I don’t believe it would
be safe to look for it, even if it was possible to
find it, which I doubt.”</p>

<p>“My poor cousin,” said Professor Snodgrass,
sadly. “I had given him up for dead, but now,
to hear that there is a possibility of him being
alive, makes me wish I could help rescue him.”</p>

<p>“And you can!” exclaimed Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“How?” asked the scientist eagerly. “Do you
mean that you are going to try to find Lost
Valley?”</p>

<p>“I certainly am,” declared Jerry, firmly. “That
is one reason why I came West in the <i>Comet</i>. I
wanted to protect our mine, but, now that we are
on hand before Noddy’s gang has arrived, I don’t
believe there is much danger on that score. We
can devote most of our time to finding the mysterious
valley, and, once we locate it, we will
rescue any who are left of the missing Deering
Band. We will search for the valley in the airship!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll never find it!” predicted Tod, with a
dubious shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t know these motor boys,” spoke
Jim Nestor, admiringly. “Once they set out to
do a thing they generally finish it. I wouldn’t
want to gamble that they couldn’t find that valley,
Tod.”</p>

<p>“Well, they may stumble on it, if they hunt long
enough, but the Indians will never let them get
into it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” declared Jerry, smiling grimly.
“Anyhow, we won’t give up until we get there.
If we can rescue those who are left it’s worth
fighting the Indians to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, and I’m with you!” cried Jim
Nestor.</p>

<p>“And you can count on me, when it comes to a
fight!” added Sledge Hammer Tod with energy.</p>

<p>The whole party now began an engrossing discussion
of the missing Amos Deering and his
friends. Tod told such other details as occurred
to him, and Professor Snodgrass was so interested
that he forgot to hunt for bugs.</p>

<p>“But what I can’t understand,” said Ned, “is
what has become of Mr. Bell? Why did he disappear
so mysteriously?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I can explain that,” replied Jerry. “He
probably learned, soon after starting with Noddy,
that Jack and the bully were not the owners of
the airship. Mr. Bell probably left in a hurry,
either before or just after the accident. He may
have imagined that we had sold the airship to
Noddy, and despairing of help in that direction
he may have come back west here.”</p>

<p>“In that case we’ll see him,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But the thing for us to do is to get
ready to hunt for that valley. As soon as we have
rested up, and given our craft an overhauling,
we’ll start for the place.”</p>

<p>The airship was made secure against storms,
and then our three heroes and Professor Snodgrass
proceeded to make themselves comfortable
in one of the several cabins at the mine. Bob’s
desire for food was gratified, the Chinese cook
soon serving an excellent meal.</p>

<p>The next two days were spent in going over
the airship, and in arranging for supplies and
provisions for the long tour. Mr. Tod went off
on a little trip, to see an old miner, and make some
inquiries regarding Lost Valley. He came back
the third day after the arrival of the boys, but the
information he secured was not much more definite
than that which he already possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll just have to prospect for that valley,”
he said.</p>

<p>“We,” repeated Jim Nestor. “Are you going
along, Tod?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I calalated that if the airship would
hold me I’d like to go. I ain’t fit any Indians for
a long time, and I’d sort of like the sensation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the airship will carry a large party,
though we have not sleeping accommodations for
many,” said Jerry. “That is, if we should happen
to rescue the people of the valley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you can make out,” answered
Tod. “But I say, Jim, you ain’t got any objections
to my goin’; have you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Glad to have you go with the
boys. I’ll have to stay here and look after the
mine, although I guess Noddy and his gang have
about given up trying to get it.”</p>

<p>How mistaken Jim was he found out three days
later. It was toward the close of the afternoon,
when he, with the three boys, was sitting near the
mouth of the shaft. Professor Snodgrass, as usual,
was out collecting specimens.</p>

<p>Up the road that led from Rockyford, the
nearest town to the gold diggings, came four figures.
The motor boys and Jim Nestor looked
up as they saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello! Something’s doing,” announced Jim,
with a snapping shut of his jaws. “There’s Mike
Malone, one of the deputy sheriffs. Wonder what
he wants?”</p>

<p>But the interest of them all was centred more
in the three figures that followed the deputy. For
they were none others than Noddy Nixon, Bill
Berry and Tom Dalsett. They came on with a
confident air.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” called Malone to the miner, as
soon as he was within hailing distance.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” answered Jim. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>Then, before the deputy sheriff could answer,
Noddy Nixon broke in with:</p>

<p>“We’ve come to take possession of our mine!
You fellows have had it long enough. We’re
going to clear you all out, and get the gold ourselves.
I told you I’d get ahead of you, Jerry
Hopkins!” and Noddy sneered at the three motor
boys, while Tom Dalsett and Bill Berry grinned
maliciously.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR LOST VALLEY</small></h2>


<p>Jim Nestor leaped to his feet, and, with a
characteristic motion, his hand sought the revolver
he always wore, but which he seldom used, for
Jim was a very peaceable man. Then, as if regretting
that he had been betrayed into action by
the taunt of a bully like Noddy, Jim sat down
again, and, looking at the deputy sheriff, asked:</p>

<p>“Did you want to see me, Mike?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I came here for,” was the
answer, “and if some people would mind their
own business, and let me attend to mine we’d get
along better,” continued Malone, as he gave
Noddy a sharp glance.</p>

<p>Jerry looked as if he was going to step forward
and engage in a wordy if not a fistic encounter
with Noddy, but in a low voice Jim Nestor bade
him keep cool.</p>

<p>“Leave it to Malone,” said the superintendent
of the gold mine. “He and I are friends. We’ll
soon see what’s in this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Malone turned to Noddy, Bill Berry and Tom
Dalsett.</p>

<p>“You fellows stay back here until I tell you to
come on,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“But it’s our mine now,” insisted Noddy. “We
have a right&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You do as I tell you, or I’ll go back to town,
and you can fight your own battle without the aid
of the courts,” interrupted Mike. Noddy gave
one look at Jim and Tod, with the three motor
boys standing in back of them. Then, coming
from the mine, for their day’s work was over,
could be seen a number of sturdy men. The force
was too big for the one Noddy had, and he wisely
agreed to keep back. Mike Malone came on
alone, and handed Jim Nestor a paper.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to do this,” he said, “but business
is business, and I’m directed by the court to serve
this on you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s some legal document in a suit over this
mine. It appears that Nixon and some others
lay claim to it.”</p>

<p>“But we own it!” cried Jerry. “Once before
Noddy Nixon disputed our title, but the courts
held that we had the sole rights to it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Malone. “All I know is that there’s another
suit on, and that I have to serve them papers on
you. Nixon and them other two fellows got an
order from the court this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re going to take the mine!” exclaimed
Noddy. “You fellows had better clear
out. We’re in possession.”</p>

<p>“You dry up!” commanded the deputy sheriff.
“If I hear another word out of you, I’ll
spank you&mdash;little whipper-snapper that you are!”</p>

<p>“We want our rights,” growled Bill Berry.</p>

<p>“If you had what was coming to you, there’d
be a striped suit on you, instead of the one you’re
wearing,” declared Jerry, and Bill only scowled.
He knew how true this was.</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” asked Jim Nestor, as
he looked over the paper. “I can’t make head or
tail out of these law terms.”</p>

<p>“It means that you can’t work the mine any
more until the dispute is decided,” said the deputy.
“It seems that there is a defect in the title,
and the statute of limitations is somehow involved.
These people&mdash;Noddy Nixon and his crowd&mdash;learned
of it, they bought the rights of a man
who used to own some shares in it, before the
mine was a paying proposition, and now they are
suing you under that claim for their share.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I thought that was all settled,” remarked
Jerry, for once before Noddy and his cronies had
tried the same kind of a game.</p>

<p>“It was, in a way, and yet it wasn’t,” answered
Malone. “There are so many loopholes
in the law that these fellows have found one, and
are sort of firing on you through it. So you
lose possession for a while.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, just as we uncovered a rich vein,”
sighed Jim.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll work it all right,” sneered Tom
Dalsett, who had gradually drawn nearer.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t!” cried Mike Malone quickly.
“Don’t you fool yourself. This mine, from now
on, is in possession of the Supreme Court of Arizona,
and I’m its representative. Nobody can
take an ounce of gold from these workings until
this dispute is settled forever.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that we can’t work our mine?”
cried Noddy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that it’s your mine,” was the reply
from the deputy, “but I do mean that you
can’t set foot inside it. Are all the men out?”
he asked of Jim, who nodded. “Then,” went
on the court official, “I hereby formally and in
the name of the court take possession of these
diggings, to remain in my possession until dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
by an order from the court, all accordin’
to the statutes in such cases made and provided!
There, I’m glad I got rid of that! I learned it
by heart, but I was afraid I’d forget it. Now
I’ll seal up the mine, with the official seal, and
any man who breaks it or enters the mine will
render himself in contempt of court, and liable
to a fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion
of the judge, which is the way the law books
have it.”</p>

<p>Having thus cleared his mind, Malone proceeded
to affix lead seals to the rude wooden
door that closed the mouth of the shaft.</p>

<p>“Does that mean we can’t go in?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It does, but it also means that they can’t go
in, either,” and Malone nodded toward Dalsett
and the others. “I’m in possession, and I intend
to remain. You haven’t got a pipeful of tobacco
you could spare, have you, Jim?”</p>

<p>Nestor handed over a plug, from which the
deputy sheriff proceeded to shave some into his
hand.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say we can’t have possession
of our mine?” cried Noddy, as Malone took his
seat on a bench in front of the shaft opening.</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean, bub, but I wouldn’t get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
excited over it. It’s too warm. You can go
back to town and cool off.”</p>

<p>“This means that we all have a vacation,
doesn’t it?” asked Nestor.</p>

<p>“Something like that,” answered the official.
“Nothing doing until the courts decide who are
the real owners.”</p>

<p>“Well, that satisfies me,” declared Jim. “We’ve
all been working pretty hard lately, and I don’t
mind a rest. Men,” he went on, turning to the
miners, “I’ll pay you off, and notify you when
I want you again. The mine is closed up.”</p>

<p>The miners did not seem to mind it much, for
they had made considerable money lately, and
had not had a chance to spend it. They hurried
to change their clothes, for a vacation in town.
As for Jerry and his chums, once they understood
that Noddy had no special advantage over them,
and that the court would rule on the question,
they were not much alarmed. They did not like
their old enemy to gain even this advantage over
them, but it could not be helped, and they had
no fear but that they would ultimately be declared
the real owners of the mine. Meanwhile,
no harm would result, as no gold could be taken
from it. At first Noddy and his two cronies
seemed about to make a determined effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
take physical possession of the diggings, but
when they understood that the deputy sheriff
meant what he said, and realized that Jim, Tod,
and the three boys would be more than a match
for them physically, they decided to withdraw.</p>

<p>They went down the road they had come, casting
malevolent glances at our heroes; but Jerry,
Ned and Bob did not mind these.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad that job’s over,” announced
Malone, as he saw Noddy disappear. “I didn’t
want to serve any papers for those scoundrels,
for I believe that’s what they are. I couldn’t
help it, however. I think there was crooked
work somewhere, to enable them to get even the
claim they say they have, but the court will soon
settle it. Meanwhile, you gentlemen can do as
you like around here. It’s only the mine that is
sealed. You can start another if you like, and,
of course, you are still in possession of the buildings,
bunk houses and the like. In fact, I hope
you’ll remain, for it’s going to be a mighty lonesome
job for me to stay here on guard all the
while, alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess we’ll stay,” said Jim. “There’s
lots of things I’ve been wanting to do, but I
haven’t had a chance. I want to go hunting
mountain lions, but I didn’t feel like leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
when we were taking out so much gold. Now
that I can’t get at it, I’ll take a vacation.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as I blame you,” agreed
Malone.</p>

<p>“Say, this is just the thing for you!” suddenly
exclaimed Sledge Hammer Tod. “It’s a lucky
thing this happened.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that,” remarked Jim. “How do
you figure it out?”</p>

<p>“Why, you can go with the boys and me in the
airship to hunt for Lost Valley,” replied the old
miner. “It’s just the chance for you. Between
us we ought to be able to locate the place, and
rescue the Deering crowd.”</p>

<p>Jim thought deeply for a few minutes. Then,
slapping his leg with a noise like a pistol shot, he
announced:</p>

<p>“By cracky! I believe you’re right. I <em>will</em> go
with you. That is, if that airship shebang is
safe,” he added cautiously.</p>

<p>“We came all the way in it,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go,” decided Jim. “The mine will
be safe with Malone in charge, and I’ll not
worry. When can we start?”</p>

<p>“In a few days,” replied Jerry. “I’m glad you
can go along, Jim, for we may need your help.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get grub, and talk it all over,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
proposed Bob, hurrying over to the cook’s shack
in order to escape any comments of his chums.
But they were too interested in the recent developments
to jibe him.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask Noddy why he stole our
airship, and what became of Mr. Bell?” suggested
Ned to Jerry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of it until he started back,” was
the reply. “His claiming our mine again sort of
knocked my ideas into a cocked hat. But when
I did think of it I decided it was best to keep
still. We’ll fool Noddy that way. If we begin
to question him he may find out that we’re going
to make a try to rescue Mr. Bell’s friends, and
spoil our plans. But it certainly is queer what
has become of the former hermit, and I would
like to know how he found out about the people
in Lost Valley. If we had Mr. Bell with us
now, he could pilot us right to the place.”</p>

<p>“Maybe his son knows.”</p>

<p>“Probably, but we can’t find his son. The last
I heard of Tommy Bell he was many miles from
here, and it would be hard to locate him. No,
I guess it’s just as well we didn’t say anything to
Noddy, though some day I’ll get even with him.
We’ll go off on our own hook now, and locate that
valley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Preparations for the trip were hurried during
the next few days.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Noddy and his cronies made an
unsuccessful attempt to get a modified order from
the court, allowing them to work the mine; but
they were defeated, and Mike Malone remained
in possession. With him on guard, the motor
boys and their friends had little to fear.</p>

<p>At last all was in readiness, and one morning,
the airship having been thoroughly gone over,
the supplies and food put on board, and everything
made taut and trim, was ready for the
start.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” called Jerry. “Come on, Professor,”
for the scientist was racing after a new
kind of butterfly.</p>

<p>“In a moment,” he answered, as, with a sweep
of his net, he imprisoned the insect. Then he
hurried into the cabin of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Jerry started the motor, and the big airship
arose with a rush, while Malone, on guard at
the mine, sent a cheer after the adventurers.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” he called.</p>

<p>Would they find the mysterious valley and rescue
the missing party, or would they themselves
fall a prey to the Indians? It was a question no
one could answer.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>WRECKED ON THE DESERT</small></h2>


<p>Though it was an exceedingly novel experience
for both Jim Nestor and Sledge Hammer
Tod to ride in an airship, one would never have
guessed it from their manner. They were as
calm and collected as though that was their usual
means of locomotion.</p>

<p>Tod looked down at the earth, which was fast
receding and in a low voice remarked to Jim
Nestor:</p>

<p>“There sits the deputy sheriff on guard.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Jim, equally calm, “as long as
he stays there things will be all right. Nixon
and his gang won’t get much gold out of that
mine.”</p>

<p>“How do you allow that the gang had the
nerve to make a try for your mine?” asked Tod,
turning to Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom Dalsett planned it,” replied Ned.
“He has been in the West for some time now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and probably thought he saw a chance to make
some money. He wrote to Noddy to come out
here, as Jerry told you, and we found the letter
when he ran away. How Noddy managed to
get West after he ran away from our airship we
can only guess. Anyhow, he did get here, and
met Dalsett. Then Bill Berry arrived, probably
on some freight train like one Jerry saw him
board. Very likely he dropped off at a junction
point, and came to Rockyford on a local. Then
the three went to court and made their claim.”</p>

<p>Jerry came from the pilot house, having fixed
the rudder stationary, after ascending to about
five hundred feet.</p>

<p>“Well,” inquired the tall lad, as he looked at
the old miner and at Jim Nestor, “how do you
like it? Is it what you thought it would be?”
He rather expected to see more of astonishment
depicted on the faces of his friends.</p>

<p>“Well, it is and it isn’t,” was the somewhat
enigmatical answer of Jim.</p>

<p>“It might be different,” added Tod, as carelessly
as he could. “If it doesn’t act like a bucking
bronco now and throw us off, it will be all
right. Something of a distance to fall,” he went
on casually, as he looked down to the earth.</p>

<p>“Well, since we’ve made a good start, suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
we plan a little about what we are going to
do,” went on Jerry. “We will have to depend
on you and Mr. Tod, Jim, to find the valley.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best. Have you got grub for
a long prospect?”</p>

<p>“We can fly around in the upper air for two
weeks if need be,” answered the tall lad, for he
had seen to it that an unusual supply of fuel and
other needful articles had been placed in the
ship.</p>

<p>“Well, we ought to find it in that time,” said
Tod. “I think, if we cruise back and forth along
the Uncompahgre Mountain range, we may see
just what we are looking for. Of course, it’s going
to take some time, but we’ve got to expect
that. If we could only meet Mr. Bell now, we
wouldn’t have any trouble.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope we shall be able to rescue
these poor people,” put in Professor Snodgrass,
looking up from his notebook. “I would very
much like to see my cousin again. Just think of
being held captive by the Indians all these years!”</p>

<p>“If they only <em>are</em> captives,” remarked Jim
Nestor.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ned quickly, detecting
a strange note in the man’s words.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean if they’re still alive,” went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the mine superintendent. “If they are, I think
we can dispose of the Indians all right.”</p>

<p>They fell to talking of the strange quest on
which they had started, the airship, meanwhile,
continuing to fly ahead toward the unknown goal.
Jerry went back to the pilot house and adjusted
the deflection rudder to send the <i>Comet</i> higher
up, so that a better view of the surrounding
country could be had. Still, there was no hope
yet of observing the mysterious valley, or even
the mountain range in which it was supposed to
be located. They were several hundred miles
away.</p>

<p>For two days they flew on, not making very
rapid time, as Jerry and the boys decided it would
be best to be sparing of their fuel, since they
were in a region where gasolene was not plentiful.
They sailed now high and now low, and
every minute a new view could be had of the
earth, the mountains and valleys below them.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was kept busy catching
and classifying many insects, but, though he kept
a diligent lookout, he had not yet seen any winged
lizards.</p>

<p>“I guess we’re flying too high for them,” observed
Jim Nestor, who took a curious interest
in the fad of the naturalist. “When we get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that mysterious valley we may find some. I’ll
help you hunt.”</p>

<p>“Will you, really?” asked the delighted professor,
for he did not often find a kindred spirit.</p>

<p>They ate and slept in the airship almost with
as much ease and comfort as they could have
done on earth, and Tod and Nestor were soon
at home above the clouds. Bob constituted himself
the cook, as probably you have already
guessed, and he would have served five meals a
day if allowed.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re getting there,” announced Jerry,
on the afternoon of the third day, as the airship
was traveling over a wide desert valley. “We
could go faster, but there’s no need. We’ll soon
be in Colorado, and over that mountain range;
then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sudden move on the
part of Professor Snodgrass. The scientist, who
had been seated on a bench in the main cabin of
the <i>Comet</i>, poring over a book, jumped up,
grabbed a long-handled butterfly net, and rushed
aft, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“There! I just saw it! The flying lizard.
Look out, everybody! I must have it! The first
specimen I’ve ever seen!”</p>

<p>Through the engine room he rushed to get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the after deck of the craft. The boys saw a
small insect winging its way past the airship, but
whether it was a flying lizard or not was impossible
to say.</p>

<p>“I must have it! I must have it!” cried the
professor.</p>

<p>As he rushed through the engine room, the
long handle of his net knocked from a shelf a
large monkey wrench. It fell against one of the
cylinders of the motor and rebounded into the
large flywheel. The wheel tossed it back against
the cylinder with great force. There was a sound
of breaking metal, a loud explosion, and the engine
suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried the professor, as he paused
in his hasty flight. “What have I done?”</p>

<p>From the pilot house Jerry came on the run.
He quickly shut off the gasolene, which was flooding
the now stationary engine. Then, as he saw
the extent of the damage the scientist had unwittingly
caused, the lad pulled a lever. There was
a hissing sound, and the airship began to settle.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jim Nestor.
“We’re falling down to the desert!” and he
looked at the vast stretch of sand below them.</p>

<p>“Has the ship busted?” asked Sledge Hammer
Tod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Part of the motor is,” replied Jerry quietly.
“I am letting some of the gas out of the bag, so
that we will go down. We will have to descend
to earth to repair the engine&mdash;if, indeed, we can
fix it. The break is a bad one,” and he looked
grave.</p>

<p>“It’s all my fault,” wailed the professor. “I
should not have been in such a hurry. I knocked
the wrench down, and the flying lizard got away,
after all.”</p>

<p>Amid an ominous silence the <i>Comet</i>, badly
damaged, settled to the sands, her first stop since
leaving the mine.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A LION IN POSSESSION</small></h2>


<p>The crippled craft of the air settled down
gently on the hot sands, skillfully guided by
Jerry. As soon as it was stationary, for it
needed no guy ropes to hold it, since most of the
gas was out of the bag, the travelers climbed
from the cabin to the surface of the desert.</p>

<p>“Whew, but it’s hot!” exclaimed Bob. “I
wouldn’t mind an ice cream cone just now.”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Chunky,” advised Ned, puckering up
his lips.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll all do if we stay here long
enough,” replied the stout lad. “Whew! I’m
going to take off some of my clothes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you and I’d better do the same,
Ned,” added Jerry. “We’ll have to get on our
overalls and see if we can fix the engine.”</p>

<p>“Is it badly smashed?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it is. Two of the cylinders seem
to be cracked,” replied Jerry, who had made a
hasty examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” put in Professor Snodgrass.
“I didn’t mean to do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was an accident,” replied Jerry pleasantly.
“It’s partly my fault, for I should not
have left the monkey wrench on the shelf where it
was likely to get knocked off. But perhaps we
can make repairs.”</p>

<p>“If you can’t, we’ll be in a bad way,” declared
Jim Nestor in a low voice to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“Because this is a big desert, and there’s no
water on it. Unless you’ve got plenty to last
until you can start again, there’s liable to be
trouble.”</p>

<p>“We have plenty, I think,” replied Jerry.
“We’ll get right to work on the engine.”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a cry from Bob, who
was on the other side of the airship.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Chunky?” called Ned.</p>

<p>“I’ve found a spring of water,” answered the
stout youth. “Let’s get a drink.”</p>

<p>Jerry hurried to where his two chums were.
There on the sands of the desert was a damp
place, as if water was present. It needed but a
glance from Jerry’s quick eyes, however, to cause
him to hurry back into the airship.</p>

<p>“It’s a leak in one of our water tanks!” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
cried. “That is no spring! Hurry, here, fellows,
and help me to transfer this water! Lively now!”</p>

<p>He did not speak of the vital need of saving
every drop of the precious fluid, but Ned and
Bob must have guessed, for they worked quickly,
and the water from the leaking tank, in which
a hole had been punched by a piece of one of the
broken cylinders, was emptied into another receptacle.
But several gallons had leaked away,
and Jerry looked more serious than before.</p>

<p>“I wish I could do something to make up for
my carelessness,” suggested the scientist. “But I
fear my knowledge of machinery&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Mr. Snodgrass,” replied
Jerry. “We will be able to get the engine in
shape, I think. I’ll cut out the two broken cylinders,
and run on eight,” for the motor was a
ten-cylinder one. “We won’t be able to go so
fast,” added the youth, “but it will serve.”</p>

<p>“Then as long as I can’t do anything, I may
as well be on the hunt for the flying lizard,” decided
the scientist, and he set off over the desert,
with his net and his specimen box.</p>

<p>“Is there anything we can do?” inquired Tod,
as he and Jim Nestor approached Jerry.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I guess,” replied the tall lad. “Ned
and Bob will help me with the engine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we’ll go off prospecting a bit,” said
Jim. “We may find a place to catch some fish,”
and he winked at Jerry, to indicate to him that
he and Tod would hunt for water. And, indeed,
Jerry knew there might soon be need of it, before
the engine was repaired.</p>

<p>But nothing was said to either Ned, Bob or
the professor on this score. Jerry did not want
any needless alarm.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows,” he exclaimed cheerfully, when
the three chums were alone beside the ship, “let’s
get busy. It’s going to be quite a job to take
out those broken cylinders.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, as they soon found. The two
cylinders which had been cracked by the flying
wrench were in the centre of the motor. To get
them out it was necessary to uncouple a number
of pipes, cams, gears and wires. Fortunately
there were the necessary tools on board, and all
three of the lads had had considerable experience
in machine work. But, even with all this, they
were all day getting the two cylinders out.</p>

<p>“Now,” announced Jerry, “it remains to be
seen whether we can connect up the other eight,
and use the water-cooling system to good advantage,”
for the motor was not an air-cooled
one. “We’re going to have trouble connecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the water pipes,” he predicted, as he wiped the
perspiration from his face.</p>

<p>It had been hard work&mdash;doubly so under the
broiling sun of the desert. At noon Nestor and
Tod had returned, but it did not need a negative
nod of Nestor’s head to tell Jerry that their
quest for water had been unsuccessful. They set
off again in the afternoon. Professor Snodgrass
had not come back to lunch, but there was nothing
remarkable in this. Often in his search for a
curious insect he had been known to go all day
without food, and he never minded it.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, while Ned and Bob were
toiling away, helping Jerry, Bob went to the
water tank, and, after taking a big drink, he
threw away what liquid remained in the glass.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that!” exclaimed Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because we might need it. No telling how
long we will be here, and water doesn’t grow on
every bush.” He tried to speak lightly, but Ned
and Bob must have guessed what he meant, for
after that it was observed that both took very
small drinks.</p>

<p>After a restless night spent in the airship, the
professor having returned just before dark, the
boys started in the next day to connect up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
eight good cylinders. They found it a harder
task than even Jerry had anticipated. All day
they hammered, bored and filed metal. They
made fitting after fitting, only to discover a leak,
and then they had to do it all over again. They
toiled until the perspiration of their hands and
faces, mingling with the grease and grime, made
them look like foundrymen. But they did not
give up. After several failures, Jerry remarked:</p>

<p>“Say, let’s knock off a bit and take a walk
over the desert. It will rest us, and we can
work better when we come back.”</p>

<p>“What? Walk in that broiling sun?” asked
Bob, shaking some drops of perspiration from
the end of his fat nose.</p>

<p>“It will do you good&mdash;dry you off,” declared
Ned. “Come on, Jerry. I’m ready.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was again off on a hunt
for the flying lizard, and the two miners had disappeared
over a little ledge of rock in search of
water. The three boys started across the hot
sands.</p>

<p>They found that the walk did rest their tired
arms and cramped legs, and though there was
nothing to see, and it was very hot, they rather
enjoyed the stroll. They went on for a mile or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
more, and then turned to go back, as night was
approaching and they did not want to be away
after dark.</p>

<p>“There comes Tod and Nestor,” remarked
Bob, pointing to the figures of the two miners,
who were approaching the stalled airship from
the southeast.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I s’pose the professor will be along
presently. When do you think we can start again,
Jerry?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll have the motor in shape to-morrow,”
remarked the tall lad. “I’ll cut some
new washers for the water pipes, and I think
that will do away with the leaks.”</p>

<p>The three lads soon joined Tod and Nestor,
and the five proceeded toward the <i>Comet</i>. In
the hot, thin air of the desert it looked to be
not more than a hundred yards away, but they
were still over half a mile from their craft.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob, who was walking a little in advance,
called out:</p>

<p>“Did you see anything move then?”</p>

<p>“Move? Where?” inquired Jerry, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“On the airship. I’m sure I saw some one on
deck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe the professor is aboard?” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“No, there he comes now,” said Tod, pointing
off to the left, where the scientist could be observed
stalking across the sand, his net over his
shoulder, and his green specimen box dangling at
his side.</p>

<p>“Somebody surely is on board,” insisted Bob.
“I saw him move again.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Nestor. “I saw something
move, too, then.”</p>

<p>They quickened their pace, and in a little while
they were near enough so that all five could observe
some shadowy form moving about on the
after deck.</p>

<p>“If it’s a man, he’s going about on all fours,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s Mr. Bell,” came from Bob.
“Maybe he’s gone crazy from the heat.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Jerry, breaking into a
run. The others followed. But when they were
within a short distance of the craft they came to a
sudden halt.</p>

<p>For from the airship there now came a series
of ugly snarls and roars.</p>

<p>“What in the world is that?” cried Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no need to answer him, for a moment
later there sprang into view, in the background
of a vivid sunset, a big mountain lion,
who paced back and forth on the forward deck.
The beast was in possession of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>MR. BELL IS FOUND</small></h2>


<p>“Come on! We must drive him out of there!”
cried Bob. “I left a lot of opened cans of food
in the kitchen, ready for supper, and that beast
will eat ’em all up! Come on, we must drive
him out!”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” exclaimed Jim Nestor, catching
Bob by the shoulder, as the impetuous youth was
about to dash forward. “You don’t know as
much about them critters as I do, son. Keep
away as far from ’em as you can, especially when
you haven’t got a gun.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got your gun, Jim?” asked Tod
quickly.</p>

<p>“No; have you?”</p>

<p>“Nope. First time I’ve been without it in a
long while,” and the old miner looked at the place
where his big revolver always hung in its leather
holster.</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Nestor. “We were foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to come away without them, but it was so hot
to pack ’em over the desert, and I didn’t think
anything would happen.”</p>

<p>“Me neither,” agreed Tod. “That critter
must have been passing, and smelled the meat
tins. It concluded it liked the airship, and it’s
making itself to home,” for the beast was leaping
about from deck to deck, passing through the
cabin and engine room as if it belonged there.</p>

<p>“Can’t we do anything to get rid of him?”
asked Jerry. “He may keep us out here all
night.”</p>

<p>“Have any of you boys got a gun?” asked
Nestor.</p>

<p>None of them had, though they each had a
rifle and revolver in the airship.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can scare him away,” suggested
Bob, who was getting anxious on account of the
food he had left in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Mountain lions don’t scare very well,” commented
Tod. “At least, that’s been my experience
with them.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the professor has a weapon,” suggested
Jim, after a pause, during which they had
drawn a little closer to the airship. The lion
seemed to resent their approach, for it kept
bounding back and forth on the side of the craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
nearest the adventurers, snarling and lashing its
lean, tawny sides with its tail.</p>

<p>“The professor never carries anything more
harmful than a butterfly net,” replied Jerry.
“I’m afraid he can’t help us.”</p>

<p>At that moment the scientist came up to where
the boys and miners stood.</p>

<p>“I didn’t get the flying lizard, after all,” lamented
the little bald-headed man. “But I saw
one. I would have had him, only my foot
slipped on a round stone, I fell down, and the
lizard flew away. But what is the matter?” he
asked, seeing the odd looks on the faces of his
friends.</p>

<p>“That!” answered Jerry, pointing to the lion,
which gave utterance to a roar.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a beautiful specimen!” exclaimed
the professor with enthusiasm. “I wish I could
capture it!”</p>

<p>“I wish you could, and skin it!” added Jim
Nestor grimly. “We are likely to be kept out
here all night by that beast.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, I’ll drive him away,” declared the
scientist, and, with his butterfly net extended, he
advanced. The lion showed his teeth and snarled
in an alarming fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come back, Professor!” cried Jim, and Mr.
Snodgrass concluded he had better do so.</p>

<p>“Let’s all advance in a body, yelling, shouting
and waving our hands,” proposed Jerry. “Maybe
we can scare him.”</p>

<p>But the lion didn’t scare much. It bounded
back and forth, snarling and howling, and seemed
about to leap off the ship and attack its annoyers.
The adventurers withdrew for a consultation.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Bob. “All that
grub&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s something more important
than grub,” interrupted Jerry. “We must get
the motor fixed, and move off this desert.”</p>

<p>“I should say so&mdash;away from these savage
beasts,” added Ned; but it was not of the beasts
Jerry was thinking&mdash;it was of the lack of water.</p>

<p>“Let’s try the yelling scheme again,” suggested
Tod. “Maybe it will work this time.”</p>

<p>It was now almost dark, but an early moon
gave promise of light. Once more they advanced
in a body toward the ship, but the lion evinced
no desire to depart. It leaped back and forth,
roaring and snarling.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass left his companions and
strolled around to the opposite side of the craft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
At once the lion began new tactics. It leaped
from side to side of the airship, as if trying to
be in two places at once.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Jerry, when he saw what
was going on. “We’ll divide our forces. Some
of us will attract his attention to the front of the
ship, and one of us can slip aboard, get a gun,
and shoot him.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Jim Nestor. “The very thing!
All of you get up front, and make all the fuss
you can. I’ll sneak aboard and get my gun.”</p>

<p>The boys, Professor Snodgrass and Tod hurried
to the bow of the <i>Comet</i>, the snarling lion
following them. This drew him away from the
stern. Yelling, leaping about, and making all
manner of queer motions in the hazy twilight, the
boys managed to hold the attention of the beast.
Jim Nestor climbed softly aboard, and got his
rifle. Then tiptoeing to where he could get a
good shot, he took careful aim and fired.</p>

<p>The great, tawny beast gave a convulsive leap
into the air, and toppled over on its back on the
forward deck. Then it began a death struggle,
which Nestor mercifully ended with another
bullet.</p>

<p>The dead lion was thrown overboard on the
sands, and the travelers congratulated themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
on coming so well out of the ordeal. Bob soon
had supper in preparation, while Jerry remained
in the engine room, planning work for the morrow.
He looked to see how much water was left.</p>

<p>“Did you find any?” he asked of Nestor, in a
low voice, so Bob, Ned and the professor would
not hear. The miner shook his head.</p>

<p>Jerry’s hopes to have the engine in shape the
next day were doomed to disappointment. Even
with the new washers, there was a leak in the
water-cooling system, and he knew he would not
dare start as long as that trouble was not remedied.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make an entirely new pipe to
establish the connection,” he said to Bob and Ned,
and they started that task. It was a hard one,
but they finished it in two days.</p>

<p>“I think it will work now,” announced the tall
lad, at the close of a hard afternoon of work.
He tested it, and found the connections as tight
as could be desired. Not a drop of water came
out. The propellers were set in motion to try
them, and worked satisfactorily. Then the gas
machine was put in operation.</p>

<p>“Why are we going to rise to-night?” asked
Bob, in some surprise. “Why don’t we stay here
until morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because,” was all the reason Jerry gave, but
he looked long and anxiously at the water supply,
as if calculating how long it would last.</p>

<p>They started off just as dusk was settling down,
and the airship was headed across the desert.
Many miles of it yet remained, and Jerry was
fearful that before they reached the limits the
supply of water would give out. Much was
needed for the motor, and it evaporated quickly.
Little could be left for drinking purposes, and it
was necessary, at all costs, to keep the engine
going.</p>

<p>The night was hot, very hot and close, and it
seemed that it would never end. On and on flew
the big airship, covering mile after mile.</p>

<p>“Whew! I’m a regular furnace!” exclaimed
Bob, getting up from his bunk. No one was
sleeping. The lad went to the water tank and
drew a full glass.</p>

<p>“Go halves with me and Ned on that, Chunky,”
said Jerry in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Halves? Why, I’ll bring you a full glass in
a minute,” and the stout lad looked toward Jerry
in the pilot house.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;don’t!” came the quick answer. “A
quarter of a glass each is all we can have&mdash;for a
while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“A quarter of a glass?” faltered Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;until we cross the desert. The motor
needs it more than we do,” for well Jerry knew
that, once the cylinders got overheated from lack
of water circulating around them, they would be
stalled again.</p>

<p>Bob choked back his thirst, but it was hard
work. How they lived through that night they
hardly knew afterward, but they did. The ration
of water was further reduced by morning,
and as the hot sun came up it showed the desert
still beneath them. There was no prospect of
water there.</p>

<p>By noon there was not another drop that could
be spared for drinking, and they had to sit with
parched tongues, and watch the sands slip along
below them. They were not flying high, as they
wanted to catch a glimpse of some lake, river or
brook. But none showed&mdash;there was only the
dry and sandy desert.</p>

<p>It seemed that they could not stand it another
moment. Jerry ran the motor as fast as he
dared, but it seemed to go very slowly, though
in reality they made good progress.</p>

<p>It was about three o’clock when Ned, who was
peering down from the bow of the airship, uttered
a joyful cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Water! Water!” he cried. “There’s a brook
just below us!”</p>

<p>Jerry stopped the <i>Comet</i> suddenly and sent it
down. It needed but a glance to show that the
desert was at an end. In a little green glade
there was a sparkling brook.</p>

<p>No water ever tasted better than did that to
the thirsty travelers. The boys drank with caution,
warned by Nestor and Tod, for too much
of the liquid at once would have made them ill.
As for the professor, nothing seemed to bother
him. It is doubtful if he even was aware of the
shortage in the drinking supply.</p>

<p>No sooner had he alighted from the airship
than he left the others revelling in the cool water,
and began to search for the flying lizard.</p>

<p>The travelers remained down all night, and
camped beside the little stream. In the morning
they replenished their tanks, and started off again.
They flew all that day, and toward the close of
the afternoon they saw in the distance a small
settlement.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better land there,” was Jerry’s
opinion. “We don’t exactly need gasolene, but
if we can get some there it may stand us in good
stead. I’ll fill the reserve tank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Down they settled, and as soon as they were
within view of the earth a crowd flocked out to
watch their descent.</p>

<p>“What place is this?” cried Jim Nestor, to a
group of men who crowded up to the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Bashfield, Colorado,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then we’re not far from the mountains and
Lost Valley; that is as near as I can calculate,”
added the miner to the boys.</p>

<p>The ship was made fast, and Jerry learned
that he could get a supply of gasolene nearby.
As he and his two chums were getting out the
cans to go for the liquid, a man was seen pushing
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Here, where you shovin’?” demanded a burly
miner, roughly but good naturedly.</p>

<p>“That airship! I must see that airship!” was
the answer of the man, who, it could now be seen,
was quite old.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t going to run away,” was the retort
of the big man. “Push in here, neighbor,
and see it. It’s a wonderful shebang. I’d like
to own one.”</p>

<p>“And I’d like to get the use of one,” murmured
the old man. “If I had it I could rescue&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not finish, for at that moment he caught
sight of Jerry and his two chums. The face of
the old man lighted up.</p>

<p>“The Motor Boys!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Jerry turned at the sound of the voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bell!” exclaimed the tall lad. “Jackson
Bell&mdash;the former hermit! Here!”</p>

<p>“That’s who I am!” cried Mr. Bell, for it was
indeed he. “Oh, I never thought I’d find you!
I&mdash;I ran away from that Nixon fellow&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come right in here,” urged Jerry, helping the
aged man into the cabin. “Come right in. We
were all anxious about you. We’ve found Mr.
Bell!” Jerry cried, to Nestor and Tod. “Now
we can locate Lost Valley, and rescue the people
from the Indians!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>OVER LOST VALLEY</small></h2>


<p>The crowd about the airship stared in wonder,
not only at the strange craft, but at Mr.
Bell, for they had heard what he had said.</p>

<p>“Right in here,” urged Jerry, leading the aged
man to the cabin. “We’ve been hoping against
hope that we’d meet you, so that you could show
us where lost valley is, and help us rescue Deering’s
Band.”</p>

<p>“Deering’s Band? Do you know about them?
Have you heard of Lost Valley?” queried Mr.
Bell, who seemed dazed.</p>

<p>“We were on our way there when we stopped
here for gasolene,” explained Bob.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” murmured the former hermit.
“I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a general explanation soon,” promised
Jerry. “Come into the cabin, everyone, and
we’ll have a talk. The crowd will stay outside,
I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd was too curious, however, to refrain
from climbing all about the available parts of the
<i>Comet</i>, but they did no harm, and as long as they
kept out of the cabin the boys did not care.</p>

<p>“First,” began Jerry, when they were all seated,
“I’ll tell Mr. Bell how we came to know about
Lost Valley,” which the lad proceeded to do, from
the theft of the airship, the recovery of it, the
flight of Noddy, the discovery of the letter the
bully let fall, and the finding of the fragments of
the one left by Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>“I understand now,” declared the aged man.
“It all fits in with what I have to tell you. I’ll
make it as brief as possible, as I want to start to
the rescue. An airship is the only thing that can
be used to save the unfortunate people, if, indeed,
any are left alive. I will begin at the beginning.</p>

<p>“After you boys took me away from Lost
Lake,” he said, looking kindly at Jerry, Ned and
Bob, “and had restored my son to me, I took up
my residence in a small town not far from here.
My son became a traveling salesman, going all
over this country, and that is one reason for my
delay in coming back from Cresville, where I went
to find you. I haven’t been able to locate my
son, and lost his address, and I guess he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
too busy to write to me. However, that does not
matter now, as I expect to hear from him soon.</p>

<p>“Well, I lived in peace and comfort in my home
in the town not far from here, and had everything
an old man could wish. One day, about
two months ago, as I was sitting on the front
stoop, I saw an aged man pass. His clothes
were in tatters, and he seemed the worst sort of
a tramp. The children in the streets were abusing
him, more from thoughtlessness than from any
desire to harm him. I made some inquiries of
them, and learned that they considered the old
man crazy.</p>

<p>“I felt sorry for him, and, after sending the
children away, I took him into my house, gave
him a meal, let him have a bath, and fitted him
with decent clothes. I then saw that he was not
crazy, but that suffering and hardship had made
him weak minded. In a few hours, after rest
and nourishment, he was able to tell me his story,
and a wonderful one it was, for it was the tale of
the prisoners of Lost Valley.”</p>

<p>“Was that man one of the survivors of Deering’s
Band?” asked Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“He was,” answered Mr. Bell solemnly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Snodgrass is a cousin of Amos Deering,”
explained Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it possible?” ejaculated Mr. Bell. “Then
he will be doubly interested in what I have to tell.
This man, whose name was Bertram Loftus, was
one of Deering’s Band. As you already know,
Mr. Deering led a party of prospectors in a search
for gold. Some of them were friends of mine.
They got to this part of the country, and heard
of a fertile valley, where gold was said to be plentiful,
and where conditions of life were almost
ideal. They started for it, only to fall in with a
band of Indians who offered to lead them to the
valley.</p>

<p>“This the savages did, but for motives of their
own. Lost Valley, as it has come to be called
since, was practically a lost valley then; that is,
only the Indians knew the location. They led the
white people into it, taking care to make the entrance
at night, and in the morning Deering and
his comrades, including women and children,
found themselves prisoners in the valley. There
was but one way out, and the Indians closely
guarded the secret of it.</p>

<p>“Well, the party tried to escape when they
found that they were prisoners, and several were
killed in the conflict, so Mr. Loftus told me. The
others resigned themselves to their fate and were
virtually made the slaves of their captors, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
took from them everything of value. Years went
on and the children grew up, the old men and
women died, until now scarcely a third of the
original band is left. Many tried to escape, but
either failed or were killed.</p>

<p>“Finally Loftus, who was a young miner when
the Indians captured him, resolved to try to get
away, hoping to be able to bring help. His escape
was carefully planned. Indeed, he did not
undertake it until many years from the time of
the captivity. All those years the poor people
had been held prisoners by the Indians. I suppose
when the savages first led them into the valley,
it was with the idea of taking what wealth
they had. But the disappearance of the band attracted
attention, and if there had been proof that
the Indians were responsible, government troops
would have been sent out, who would have exterminated
the redmen. This risk of government
aid made it necessary for the savages to guard
their prisoners closely. Well, as I said, Loftus
planned his escape, and he accomplished it after
terrible hardships.</p>

<p>“When he finally climbed out of the valley he
was almost as badly off as before. He traveled
on, but his mind became a blank, and finally he
found himself in my town. There the treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
I gave him restored his reason, and he told me
his story. It was three years after his escape
that I came across him, and all that while the
poor people in the valley had doubtless been waiting
in vain for some sign of the help he promised
to bring, while he had been aimlessly wandering
about, having practically forgotten his mission.</p>

<p>“I told him I would aid him, and when he
described the valley, and how difficult it was to
approach, I at once thought of an airship as the
only possible means. Then, naturally, I thought
of you motor boys, for I had read of your <i>Comet</i>.
I told Mr. Loftus that he and I would set out for
Cresville, see you, and get you to help us. But
the day before we were to start, Mr. Loftus died.
The hardships he had suffered had been too much
for him. I felt very badly, but I resolved to
carry out, with your help, the work he had undertaken.
After seeing that he was provided with
decent burial, I started for the East, intending to
seek out you boys. I sent word to my son where
I was going, as he was away from home. Well,
this story is getting pretty long, but it will soon
be finished.”</p>

<p>“It is intensely interesting,” observed Professor
Snodgrass, who, for the first time since he had
joined the boys, was not looking for specimens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I came East,” went on the former hermit,
“and reached Cresville. There I met Noddy
Nixon, and, on inquiring where you motor boys
lived, was told. He wanted to know my errand,
and foolishly I told him. I also said that the
trip to Lost Valley might result in securing a large
amount of gold, for Loftus said that his comrades
had found a number of nuggets.</p>

<p>“That was indiscreet on my part, as I discovered
later. Noddy Nixon untruthfully told
me that he was a great friend of you boys, and
that he owned part of the airship. He said you
three were away from home just then, but that
he would take me in the airship, and we would
start for Lost Valley, picking you up on the way.
I believed him, and, in company with another lad,
whom he called Pender, we went one night to the
airship shed. I thought at the time that it was
rather odd to get it at night, but Noddy made
some excuse.</p>

<p>“Well, we were admitted to the airship shed
by the watchman, and I took my place in this
cabin where we are now. Afterward I heard
something of a struggle, but I thought little of it.
We started off, and all seemed to go well, Noddy
managing the airship quite skillfully. Then came
the accident the next morning, and while he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Pender were discussing it, I was writing a letter
to my son. From something the two boys said
I learned that they had stolen the airship from
you, and I resolved to go away from them at
once. I tore up the letter I had written to my
son, telling of the attempt I was to make to rescue
the poor people of the valley, and hastily fled.
Noddy tried to stop me, but I would not stay. I
left them, and I have not seen them since.</p>

<p>“Very foolishly, I thought the ship was damaged
beyond repair, and I feared you would
blame me. I resolved to return home until I
could see my son, and have him explain matters
to you. On my way here I was robbed, and had
no money for carfare. No one would believe
the story I told, I could get no aid, I had lost
my son’s address, and I had to tramp nearly all
the way back West. I arrived home a week ago,
and was visiting some friends here when I saw
the airship come down.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for us you did,” remarked Jerry. “Now
you can take us to Lost Valley.”</p>

<p>“Are you still determined to go?” asked Mr.
Bell.</p>

<p>“You bet!” cried Bob and Ned in a breath.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” spoke the former hermit. “I
have not yet been able to communicate with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
son. I hardly knew what to do, as I wanted to
fulfill the mission on which Mr. Loftus started.
When I saw your airship I hoped to be able to
induce the owners of it to aid me in my quest, but
I had no idea I would meet you boys. I imagined
your craft was hopelessly smashed.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Noddy’s fault that it kept together
after the way he handled it,” observed Jerry.
“But we soon had it in shape again, after he and
Jack Pender ran away. We couldn’t imagine
what had happened to you, but it’s all clear now.
We’ll start for Lost Valley at once.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Not so loud,” cautioned Mr. Bell.
“Few people around here know the story of Deering’s
Band. It happened long ago, you see, and
now if it was to be known that there was gold in
the valley there would be a rush there, men would
lose their way and be killed, and no good would
result. Or, if they found the valley, and tried
to enter, the Indians might kill the few remaining
members of the band, to do away with all evidence
against themselves. Our best plan will be
to go at this quietly. Slip off, go to the valley,
and try to effect a rescue. I can show you the
way, for Mr. Loftus, before he died, left me a
rude map of the locality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s a great story,” commented Jim Nestor
when Mr. Bell had finished.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” added Sledge Hammer Tod. “I
want a chance to handle some of them Indians.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get it,” promised Jerry. “Boys, we
must go for the gasolene at once. Then we can
slip away after dark, and no one will be the
wiser.”</p>

<p>They came out of the cabin. The crowd around
the airship was greater than ever, and the boys
and other occupants of the craft were overwhelmed
with questions. They answered as well
as they could, but said nothing of the object of
their trip. Mr. Bell remained in the cabin, as he
was tired.</p>

<p>In a short time the water, oil and gasolene
tanks were refilled, and then supper was served,
with Bob, of course, in the rôle of cook.</p>

<p>It was quite late ere the last of the stragglers
had seen enough of the airship and departed.
Then, when all was in readiness, the bag was filled
with gas, and an ascent was made without the
use of the planes or propellers, thus rendering
their departure noiseless. When the <i>Comet</i> was
about two thousand feet high, the propellers were
started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which way shall we head, Mr. Bell?” asked
Jerry, as he took his place in the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Northeast,” was the former hermit’s reply, as
he consulted the map left by the man who had
escaped from Lost Valley. “We are several
hundred miles from the place.”</p>

<p>“We can reach it by to-morrow,” announced
Jerry, a grim look on his face.</p>

<p>All that night the airship rushed on, and in the
morning it was still crossing the rugged mountains.
On and on it flew. Now the scene below
would be lost in a dense fog, and again sharp
peaks would rear themselves from the sea of
mist. On and on they went, never halting.</p>

<p>It was toward evening that Mr. Bell, who by
turns had been looking at the map and observing
the landscape below through a telescope, suddenly
called out:</p>

<p>“Slow down, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Are we going to hit
something?” inquired the tall lad, who was in
the motor room, while Ned was steering.</p>

<p>“No, there’s no danger of hitting anything,”
answered Mr. Bell, “but just ahead of us I see
the tall peak that marks the entrance to Lost
Valley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lost Valley? Are we there?” cried Ned, as
he threw the propellers out of gear.</p>

<p>“We’re almost there,” replied the former
hermit.</p>

<p>A moment later the curtain of mist was brushed
aside by the wind, and <a href="#image01">the travelers saw below
them a long, narrow valley</a> held between sheer
cliffs of great height. It was no wonder that
escape from it was almost impossible. An instant
later the airship had swung farther over the deep
chasm, and then the white vapor was once more
brushed across the valley, shutting it from view.</p>

<p>“The fog served us a good turn,” said Jim
Nestor. “It will prevent the Indians from sighting
us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll descend now,” decided Jerry, “anchor
for the night, and then decide what is best to
do.”</p>

<small>THE FLICKERING LIGHTS</small></h2>


<p>Wild and desolate was the region in which
the adventurers now found themselves. They
were in the midst of the mountains, seemingly
with no civilization near, yet they knew that within
a few miles of them was the remains of an intrepid
body of whites and a band of savage Indians.</p>

<p>The airship was anchored in a comparatively
level place, and Bob, as usual, prepared the meal.
Jerry and Ned busied themselves about the craft,
making some minor adjustments to the machinery,
and seeing that it was in shape for quick
service.</p>

<p>“Have you thought how you are going to rescue
those people, in case you can get down into
the valley?” asked Jim Nestor of Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; go right down in the valley and
get them,” decided the tall lad.</p>

<p>“What about the Indians?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to fight them, I suppose,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“There are quite a number,” declared Mr.
Bell. “If possible, it would be better to do the
rescue work quietly. The redmen may prove
too many for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, when you’re dealing with an Indian, the
quieter you can go about things, the better,” put
in Tod. “Surprise ’em, if you can.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be guided by you, Mr. Bell and
Mr. Nestor,” replied Jerry deferentially. “I admit
I don’t know much about fighting Indians.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can get on this airship all
the people you hope to rescue?” asked Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“It depends on how many there are.”</p>

<p>“There can’t be more than ten,” answered Mr.
Bell. “Mr. Loftus said there were fifteen left
when he escaped. Some were so old and feeble
then that there was scarcely any hope for them.
Not more than ten left, I should say.”</p>

<p>“I hope my cousin, Amos Deering, is among
them,” remarked the scientist.</p>

<p>“He was alive and in good health when Mr.
Loftus made his escape,” said the former hermit.
“He was looked up to as a sort of chief by the
Indians, who treated him better than they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the others, of whom they made slaves, and compelled
them to assist in some peculiar form of
worship they have. I understood from Mr. Loftus
that the Indians venerated a form of lizard.”</p>

<p>“A lizard!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass.
“You don’t by any possible chance mean a flying
lizard, do you?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what Mr. Loftus said it was,”
came the unexpected reply from the aged man.
“They worship a big flying lizard, of which there
are numbers in the valley. It is as sacred to
them as the beetle was to the Egyptians. There
are many of them, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then I shall get my specimens, after all!”
cried the little bald-headed man. “Let us start
for the valley at once!” and he jumped to his feet
in his excitement.</p>

<p>“We can’t see to do anything until morning,”
objected Tod. “Then we’ll start in.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish morning would come quickly,”
went on the professor, as eager as a child over a
new toy. “I want a flying lizard very much.”</p>

<p>“Can the airship carry ten additional persons?”
asked Jim Nestor of Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, for a while, though of course we have
not rations enough for that number for very
long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will not need do more than rescue them
from the valley,” said Mr. Bell eagerly. “I will
take charge of them after that, and they can stay
at my house. I can make room for them.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it proves to be true about the gold
they discovered in the valley,” went on Nestor,
“they can pay their own way.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I take much stock in that gold
business,” came from Sledge Hammer Tod. “I’ve
heard too many stories of gold in mysterious valleys,
and generally they were fakes.”</p>

<p>“I believe there is gold in Lost Valley, and that
the prisoners have some,” insisted Mr. Bell
firmly. “Whether we will be able to rescue them
or not is another matter.”</p>

<p>They talked until far into the night of what
lay before them, and then, as they expected to
have a hard day of adventures when the sun rose,
it was decided to go to bed.</p>

<p>It must have been around two o’clock that
Jerry awakened with a start. At first he thought
some one had called him, but he waited and
listened; he heard no one else stirring aboard the
anchored <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Guess I dreamed it,” he mused; “but, as long
as I’m awake, I’ll get a drink of water.”</p>

<p>He went to the tank, and, as he passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
cabin window that looked toward Lost Valley,
Jerry was startled by seeing strange lights flickering
up toward the sky.</p>

<p>“Northern lights,” was his exclamation; and
then, as he stood and watched the mysterious
beams, he realized that his first impression was
wrong. For the lights seemed to reach from
the earth to the sky, and did not emanate from
the heavens. Nor did they have the usual characteristics
of Northern lights. They were more
like the beams from some searchlight. They
were six in number, and seemed to wave to and
fro.</p>

<p>“That’s odd,” remarked the lad. “Guess I’ll
call Bob and Ned, and see what they think of
’em.”</p>

<p>He awoke his chums, and the three gazed at
the flickering lights.</p>

<p>“Electricity, I guess,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” agreed Bob. “Probably there’s a
storm somewhere in the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Those lights are not from electricity, nor are
they the reflection of some storm,” spoke a voice
at the side of the boys, and they turned to see
Professor Snodgrass standing beside them. “See
how the lights wave to and fro regularly,” he
added. “The color, too, is not natural. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
like the reflection from some fire, in which smoke
is mingled.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose causes them?” inquired
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Human beings,” was the quick answer. “I
think those are signal lights.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” came another voice, and Mr.
Bell, who, like the professor, had been awakened
by the boys, came to the window. “Those are
signal lights,” went on the aged man.</p>

<p>“Where from?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“From Lost Valley. The Indians are signaling.”</p>

<p>“Have they discovered our presence?” Bob
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” was the answer. “But it is more
likely that the Indians in the valley are signaling
to some of their number who have gone outside
for food and supplies, which is their custom. Mr.
Loftus told me that they generally signal by
means of fires made from a peculiar wood, and
the gleams from the blazes are thrown up into
the air, out of the valley, from highly polished
stones.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to hear that explanation,” remarked
Bob, with a little shiver. “I was beginning
to think they were ghost lights.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>BUSHES OF DEATH</small></h2>


<p>They watched the strange lights for some time,
as the luminous shafts flickered up to the sky and
died out. Then, when the last of them had vanished,
the adventurers went back to bed.</p>

<p>In the morning various plans were talked over,
but the one finally decided on was this:</p>

<p>The airship would be sent over the valley,
traversing it along its entire length, but sufficiently
high so that the Indians down below&mdash;or,
for that matter, their white captives&mdash;could not
discern it. For the rescue party wanted to remain
in seclusion.</p>

<p>By means of powerful telescopes the valley
would be carefully inspected, and, if possible, a
place would be picked out where the airship could
land.</p>

<p>“For we’ve got to go down sooner or later,
if we expect to rescue those poor people,” said
Jerry. “We can’t keep in the air all the while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and lower ropes to them so that they can climb
up. That would answer for sailors, but not for
old men and women. We will have to land, and
if we pick out a secluded spot we may be able
to descend without attracting the attention of the
Indians. Then we can plan further to make the
rescue.”</p>

<p>This was decided on, and they sailed slowly
onward, Jerry and Jim Nestor and Mr. Bell taking
turns at scanning the deep chasm through the
telescope. They saw that the valley was a fertile
place, and that many fields for crops were laid
out, showing that the Indians or their white captives
were industrious. Small houses or huts
could be observed, built in some sort of order,
like a small village. All these were in the centre
of the valley through which ran a small stream,
giving plenty of water. At either end of the big
chasm there were wild and desolate spots, and it
could be seen that the sides of the place were so
steep and rugged that climbing them was out of
the question. Yet the Indians had a path in and
out, but they guarded the secret well, since only
one man in all those years had been able to discover
it. Later it was learned that the pass, by
which Mr. Loftus escaped was not the one the
Indians used, and soon after he left it was located<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and closed by the redmen, thus making it impossible
for any other of the captives to take
advantage of it.</p>

<p>“Can you see any persons moving about in the
valley?” asked Jerry, as he handed the telescope
to Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“I thought I could, the last time I looked,”
was the answer, “but I’m not sure. I’ll look
again.”</p>

<p>He peered long and earnestly through the
glass, and then uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“There are some of the red beggars!” cried
the mine superintendent. “They are having a
regular procession, and seem to be going in some
sort of a church.”</p>

<p>“Probably they are going to worship the flying
lizard,” observed Mr. Bell. “Mr. Loftus said
they hold services several times during the day
and night.”</p>

<p>“The flying lizard!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass.
“Let’s descend at once, and get some of
those most valuable specimens! They are worth
five hundred dollars each.”</p>

<p>“And our lives wouldn’t be worth five cents
apiece,” spoke Sledge Hammer Tod quickly, “if
we went down there among those savages now.
It would be all up with us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you see any white persons?” inquired
Mr. Bell anxiously, as Jerry finished his observation
through the telescope.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the lad. “It’s hard to distinguish
any figures at all, and I don’t want to
go lower, for fear they may sight us. I can’t
tell whether those I see are Indians or whites.
Can you, Jim?”</p>

<p>“No. Very likely the white people are nearly
like the redmen now, from having lived among
them so long.”</p>

<p>Over the whole length of the valley went the
airship, but nothing more was disclosed. There
were no indications that the presence of the <i>Comet</i>
was observed, and, having gotten to the end of
the big defile, the craft was sent back.</p>

<p>It was decided that a place just inside, but at
the lower end of the valley, and near the spot
where they had first landed after sighting the
chasm, would be the best place on which to descend.
As they neared it, on their return trip, a
wall of fog shut it from view, but as its location
had been carefully observed on the first trip, little
apprehension was felt.</p>

<p>The adventurers returned to the place of their
first camp in the mountains, just outside the valley,
and prepared to stay there until it should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
dark enough to make the descent into the abode
of the prisoners.</p>

<p>“If we could only drop some message to the
poor captives,” suggested Bob, “then they would
know we were coming for them.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be safe,” declared Jerry. “The
Indians might get it and decipher it. We’ll have
to take our chances at notifying them suddenly.”</p>

<p>After it grew dark the same mysterious lights
were observed that had puzzled the travelers the
first night. The adventurers decided to wait until
the flickering gleams died away before venturing
on a descent.</p>

<p>It was nearly three o’clock before this time
came, and then Jerry, who had been on the watch,
awakened the others. The airship was in readiness
for a quick and silent move. The restraining
ropes were cast off, and it rose high in the
air. Then, running the motor at half-speed, to
reduce the noise, Jerry guided the craft over the
valley. The searchlight was brought into play to
locate the landing place. There was a certain
risk in this, but it could not be avoided, and it
was hoped that the gleams from the big lantern
would be taken for the flashing of some of the
Indians’ own signal fires.</p>

<p>Lower and lower sank the <i>Comet</i>, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
mysterious valley. Lower and lower, until, with
no alarm having been sounded by the Indians, it
came to rest in the secluded and wildly desolate
spot that had been picked out that day. In the
darkness it landed, and Ned opened the gas valve
so that there would be no necessity for fastening
the ship to the earth.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are,” said Bob in a low voice,
as he tried to penetrate the darkness. “And land
sakes! how sleepy I am. I had a good rest, too,
but it seems as if I’d been awake two nights.”</p>

<p>“I’m sleepy, too,” admitted Jerry; while as
for Ned, no sooner had he finished helping Jerry
make a landing than he tumbled into his bunk and
was snoring.</p>

<p>“What’s that funny smell?” asked Jim Nestor,
sniffing the air. “Don’t you notice it, Tod?”</p>

<p>“I do notice something peculiar,” replied the
old miner. “But I’m too sleepy to care. I’m
going to turn in.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d all better do that,” added Jerry,
stifling a yawn. “I don’t know when I’ve been so
sleepy. I s’pose it’s on account of having been
up so much nights lately.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, who had been peering
about in the darkness, sniffing vigorously on various
sides of the airship, suddenly entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
cabin. The sight that met his eyes was a curious
one. Stretched out on the bunks were all the
members of the party save himself. Everyone
was either asleep or preparing to slumber. The
bald-headed scientist once more breathed the peculiar
odor on the night air, then he cried out:</p>

<p>“Jerry! Ned! Bob! Wake up, everyone!
Don’t go to sleep!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Bob drowsily.</p>

<p>“Because we have landed in a thicket of the
bushes of death!”</p>

<p>“The bushes of death?” asked Jerry, almost
too sleepy to know what he was saying. “What
are they?”</p>

<p>“Bushes that give off a peculiar odor,” answered
the scientist. “It is death to breathe it&mdash;death
by a slow languor that begins with a sleep.
No wonder the Indians avoid this end of the valley.
It is death to sleep here! We must all keep
awake until morning, and then move to some
other location. Wake up, everyone!” and he began
shaking the sleepers vigorously, for they all
were stretched out, with closed eyes. The bushes
of death had already begun to exert an influence
over them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR’S COUSIN</small></h2>


<p>Though Professor Snodgrass worked desperately
to keep his companions awake, he was at a
disadvantage, for he, too, was beginning to feel
the influence of the unseen but deadly bushes. His
eyes were heavy, and his feet began to lag as he
hurried about the cabin, shaking first one and then
another of the men or boys.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Bob&mdash;Jerry!” he cried, but Bob
only answered as he fell back in his bunk:</p>

<p>“Oh, let me alone! I’m so sleepy and tired!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured the scientist, “but it means
rest forever if you sleep now! Wake up!” and
he punched Bob vigorously.</p>

<p>The professor himself was fighting like a Trojan
to ward off sleep.</p>

<p>“I must do something to save them&mdash;save myself,”
he thought, as he looked on Tod and Nestor,
both slumbering heavily, while it seemed that
Jerry’s breathing was already becoming less vigorous
as the deadly fumes overcame him. “I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
move the airship alone,” thought the scientist,
“and it would hardly be safe to do so in the darkness.
Yet I must take some action. If there
was only some way of overcoming the fumes, or
making them less harmful&mdash;&mdash;” he paused suddenly
in his musing. His scientific mind was at
work. Already he was recalling what he knew
of the fatal bushes. He had once analyzed the
juice from them, for it was from the sap that the
exhalation came, carrying death. The bushes only
gave off the odor at night. In the day they were
harmless.</p>

<p>“I must make some other kind of fumes that
will neutralize those of the bushes of death,”
reasoned Professor Snodgrass. “Let me see what
will be the most effective.”</p>

<p>He had a small stock of chemicals with him,
and it did not take him long to decide which he
would use. He made a mixture of sulphur, carbolic
acid, creosote and some other acids, and
placed them in a pan. This he placed on top of
the gasolene stove, and lighted a fire beneath it.
All the while the scientist himself was fighting
off sleep, but as he was vigorously moving about,
and as he realized what it would mean to succumb,
it served to keep him awake. The others
were slumbering more heavily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Rapidly the professor worked. When the mixture
was sending forth the badly smelling fumes,
which, however, would serve to kill the exhalations
from the bushes, the scientist carried the
pan into the cabin. Then, suspending it over a
small lamp, he caused a still greater vapor to be
given off. The cabin was filled with the fumes.</p>

<p>“Wake up now! Wake up!” urged the scientist
again, as he roused the sleepers. Already the
good effects of the boiling mixture were apparent,
for Mr. Snodgrass felt less sleepy. Once he had
aroused the others, he knew they would be comparatively
safe. He managed, after strenuous
work, to shake them so that they opened their
eyes. Jerry was the hardest to arouse, for he had
worked hard that day, and was exhausted. But
finally they were all sitting up, staring stupidly
about them, scarcely aware of what had taken
place, yet knowing it was something unusual.
They sniffed the strong odor, and it served to
drive out from their lungs the fumes of the
bushes. In a little while the air of the cabin was
entirely void of the dangerous exhalations. The
carbolic acid and other chemicals had neutralized
them.</p>

<p>“Now, Bob, make strong coffee,” urged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
professor. “That will complete the work I started
and will make us all feel better.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Ned drowsily, while
the others rubbed their heavy eyes.</p>

<p>The professor explained. Soon Bob had made
a big pot of the strong beverage, and it was
gratefully received.</p>

<p>“We’d better get away from this place as soon
as we can,” remarked Jerry, when he was himself
again. “We must move the ship at once.”</p>

<p>“There is no need of that,” the professor
assured him. “With the fumes from the chemicals
filling the airship, it will be perfectly safe
to stay here. It does not smell very nice, but it
is better than being killed by sleep. We can now
shut our eyes and take an ordinary nap, without
fear. The chemicals will boil all night. In the
morning there will be no danger, for the plants
only exhale an odor at night. Then, when it is
light, we can see to move the ship to a place where
there are none of the bushes of death.”</p>

<p>This plan was followed, but it was not without
a little feeling of fear that the adventurers
stretched out once more for a needed rest. The
night passed safely, however, though they all
awoke with a heavy feeling, due to the fumes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
had been obliged to breathe in order to preserve
their lives. They hurried out to the fresh air
as soon as it was daylight, and inhaled deeply of
the oxygen.</p>

<p>“There are the dangerous bushes,” announced
the professor, pointing to a tangle of them near
the bow of the airship. “I think we can find a
place where there are none. And I think we can
move the ship there without danger of the Indians
seeing us. If I know anything about savages,
they will avoid this end of the valley. It
may be that they depend on the bushes of death
to keep their white captives from escaping this
way, by impressing on them the danger of never-waking
sleep should they venture here.”</p>

<p>The boys gathered about the scientist, and
looked toward the clump of peculiar-looking
bushes. The leaves resembled long green serpents,
and waved and wiggled uncannily in the
breeze, not unlike so many reptiles.</p>

<p>After breakfast, following some cautious scouting
on the part of the boys, the airship was slightly
inflated, and, moving along but a short distance
above the ground, was taken to another location,
well away from the bushes of death.</p>

<p>“Now,” remarked Jerry, when they had all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
gathered in the cabin, “we must consider how we
are to save these poor people. What is to be
our first move?”</p>

<p>“We had first better get some information as
to how the land lies,” remarked Jim Nestor. “We
want to find where the houses of the whites are
located, what is the best time to attempt the rescue,
when the Indians are least likely to be about,
and information of that sort. Yes, we must do
some scouting.”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” agreed Tod, “and I was about
to propose that Jim and I undertake it. We
know something of Indians, even if these redmen
are of a strange tribe. We’ll get the information
you need.”</p>

<p>“Such information would certainly be desirable,”
put in Mr. Bell. “My late friend, Mr.
Loftus, did not go much into details on those
points. We must depend on a surprise to overcome
the Indians. If we only could get word to
the whites that we are here, they could, perhaps,
tell us how to proceed.”</p>

<p>“That’s hardly possible,” remarked Jerry. “I
guess we will have to depend on Jim and Mr.
Tod. Still, that’s somewhat dangerous, for if they
discover them it will be all up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob, who had gone out on the forward deck,
came hurrying in, his face white with fear. He
was trembling.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry, noticing his
chum’s agitation.</p>

<p>“There’s a man&mdash;outside&mdash;he’s looking at the
airship,” stammered Chunky. “An old man, with
a long white beard. He’s coming this way.”</p>

<p>“The Indians!” cried Ned. “They have discovered
us!”</p>

<p>Jim Nestor and Sledge Hammer Tod reached
for their rifles, and looked to the revolvers at
their side. Jerry, hardly knowing what he was
doing, started from the cabin to go out on deck.
He was followed by Mr. Bell and the professor.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the deck they saw the
old man. He was staring at the airship, as if in
a dream, and it needed but a glance at him, to tell
that he was a white, and not an Indian. At the
sight of the figures of Jerry and his friends, the
man uttered a cry, and started forward. At the
same instant Professor Snodgrass fairly leaped
overboard from the ship to the ground. He
rushed toward the old man, with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>“Amos Deering!” cried the scientist! “My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
long-lost cousin! Amos Deering, of all men in
the world!”</p>

<p>The old man seemed dazed. He stood still.
Then he spoke in a hollow voice:</p>

<p>“Who are you, and why are you here?”</p>

<p>“I am your cousin, Uriah Snodgrass,” was the
reply, “and we have come in this airship to save
you and all the others!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>PLANNING THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>The announcement of Professor Snodgrass
seemed to add to the confusion of the aged man
who stood and stared at the airship. He made
no motion to return the greeting of the scientist.</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand?” repeated the little
bald-headed man. “We’ve come to save you,
Amos. You are Amos Deering, aren’t you? I
recognized you at once, though it has been many
years since I have seen you. We all gave you
up for dead.”</p>

<p>“I might better be dead&mdash;I and all the rest of
us, than captives as we are,” was the despairing
answer.</p>

<p>“But you are going to be saved!” cried the
professor.</p>

<p>“Saved?” repeated Mr. Deering, for it was
indeed he. “I can scarcely believe that. All
hope of escape was given up years ago. We
thought one of our number&mdash;Loftus by name&mdash;would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
bring aid, but we have heard nothing from
him these three years.”</p>

<p>“And it is due to him that we are here now!”
cried Mr. Bell. “We have come to save you!”</p>

<p>A gleam of interest lighted up the dull eyes
of the old man. He seemed struggling to recall
some long-forgotten facts, and then, as the professor
and Mr. Bell went over in brief the story of
how they had arrived, Mr. Deering exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It hardly seems possible. Are we to be saved?
I did not recognize you, Uriah, when I saw you
running toward me.”</p>

<p>“I would have known you anywhere,” said the
professor. He had a wonderful memory, or he
never could have classified so many strange insects.
“But come into the cabin,” urged the scientist.
“You are just in time. We were planning
how we might rescue all of your party who
are yet alive, and we needed to communicate with
some members of it.”</p>

<p>“There are only eight left,” was the sad answer.
“Five men and three women. But it will
seem wonderful to them when I take them word
that you are here. Wonderful! Wonderful!”</p>

<p>“How is it that the Indians allowed you to
come this far alone?” asked Mr. Bell. “Loftus
said they guarded you closely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“They do, usually,” answered aged Mr. Deering,
“but now they are preparing for the annual
flying lizard feast&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The flying lizard feast!” interrupted the professor.
“Is it possible for me to secure some of
those wonderful insects, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” was the answer. “But it will be
risky, for they are much venerated by the savages.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better rescue these poor people
first?” suggested Jim Nestor, “and let the lizards
go?”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll make the rescue first,” agreed
the scientist, “but I’m not going to leave this valley
until I have one of those valuable insects.
No, not if I have to enter the temple alone and
defy all the Indians in it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” said Mr. Bell, who had formed
a liking for the professor. “But suppose your
cousin tells us his story.”</p>

<p>“It is soon told,” answered Mr. Deering. “As
I said, the Indians are preparing for a great feast,
in connection with the annual changing of the
flying lizard. Every year they take one lizard
from the temple, and either kill it or let it fly
away to the woods, and substitute a new one.
There are strange ceremonies connected with this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and a great feast. At such times they relax their
vigilance over us, but not sufficiently to permit us
to escape. I took advantage to-day of the fact
that most of the Indians are preparing for the
feast, and slipped away. I wanted to be alone
and think. You can imagine my surprise when I
saw this great airship here. I thought I had suddenly
gone insane.”</p>

<p>“And you say there are only eight of you left?”
asked Jerry. “How can we best rescue them, for
we are determined to take you and them away?”</p>

<p>“It will be a difficult task, I fear,” answered
Mr. Deering, “but if you attempt it, the best time
will be two nights hence, when they are at the
lizard feast. Then we captives are allowed to be
together and are not guarded, though at other
times we are virtually slaves. I will tell my
friends that you are here, and we will be in readiness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Deering then related, in brief, the story
of how he and his comrades, years before, had
been enticed into the valley by the Indians. The
story is already known to my readers, so I will
not again go over it. Sufficient to say that the
aged man gave more details and told of the numerous
times they had tried to escape, and how
most of their number had gradually died. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Indians were not specially cruel to them, he added,
but kept them close prisoners. There was but
one way out of the valley, and this was known
only to the Indians, though Loftus had managed
to find a path that served him. This, however,
was now closed.</p>

<p>The valley was a fertile one, and most of the
things needed could be raised in it. Occasionally
parties of the Indians would go out, and then
those who stayed behind, to guard the captives,
would light signal fires to show their companions
the way back. It was these lights our friends
had seen.</p>

<p>Aside from the worship of the flying lizard, the
traits of the Indians were not greatly different
from others of their kind. They had all the redman’s
failings and savagery.</p>

<p>“The feast of the lizard and the ceremonies
connected with it, take place in a large temple, or
council house, in the middle of the village,” explained
Mr. Deering. “There, two nights hence,
will be gathered all the savages.”</p>

<p>“And then we will come to the rescue!” exclaimed
Jerry. “Between then and now we will
form our plans. Can you come out to us again,
so that we can tell them to you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” answered the old man. “I think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
will be able to do so. And another thing: you will
be well paid for your trouble, for we captives,
unknown to the Indians, have a fortune in gold
nuggets hidden away.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>IN DISGUISE</small></h2>


<p>For a moment after the announcement of Mr.
Deering about the gold no one spoke. Then Mr.
Bell said:</p>

<p>“That is the story told by Loftus, but I feared
his mind was wandering.”</p>

<p>“No, it is true,” went on the professor’s cousin.
“One of the huts assigned to us happened to be
over a rich deposit of gold. I and some others
discovered it when we were digging a tunnel to
escape in the early days of our captivity. We
soon gave up the plan of tunneling out of the
valley, and dug for the gold. We found plenty,
which we hid, but we never imagined it would be
of any service to us, for we had given up hope of
escaping.”</p>

<p>“And now you’ll soon have a chance to spend
some of it,” observed Nestor with a laugh. “If
everything goes well, and I don’t see why it
shouldn’t, you’ll soon be in civilization again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with your friends, and can see something of the
world.”</p>

<p>“To go back into the world again!” cried the
old man, with emotion. “How strange it sounds
to hear those words! We expected to die and be
buried in Lost Valley, with never a sight of our
friends or relatives again. Now I have hope!”
He paused for an instant, as if overcome by his
thoughts, and then added: “I must hurry back
now, or I shall be missed, as it is getting late.
But I will return here the first chance I get.”</p>

<p>Following the aged man’s departure several
plans were discussed. Jim Nestor proposed that
the attack be made on the Indians while they
were at their services in the temple of the flying
lizard.</p>

<p>“If we do that, some of us will have to be on
hand to know just when that time is,” objected
Tod. “We’ll have to be in the temple, or near
it.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed Jim. “That’s my idea. You
and I can go, watch our chance, notify the white
captives to slip away, and, if necessary, stand off
the Indians, for they may catch on, and try to
stop the rescue. Yes, Tod, you and I will have
to go to the temple of the flying lizard, if there
is such an insect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, there is!” cried Professor Snodgrass. “I
know it. But I must beg of you to allow me to
be of the party, for it will be my only chance to
secure one of the curious insects. I, also, must
go to the temple.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go, too,” spoke Ned. “I want to
see the curious rites of the ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jerry, with a smile, “I guess
we all would like to go, but it’s hardly possible.
I suggest we draw lots for it. Four of us will go,
and the others stay here to defend the ship if
necessary. There may be a fight.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you take the airship near enough,
make a sudden descent, and pick up the people
who could be in waiting?” suggested Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered Jerry. “We would
have to sail so slowly that we would lose steerage
way, and then, too, if the Indians are celebrating
they’ll have many fires, and the airship would
show plainly. They would detect us, rush out,
and, perhaps, damage the ship, which would be
low down. Then we would all be captives together.”</p>

<p>“I guess Jerry’s right,” added Jim Nestor.
“We will have to work in the dark. That is,
sneak into the temple, watch our chance, and,
when the right time comes, which will be when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the Indians are so busy they won’t notice us, and
then lead the whites to where the airship is. Here
is as good a place for it as any. Then we can
fly off before the Indians see us. Get the lots
ready, Jerry. I hope I’m one to go.”</p>

<p>He was; Jerry, Ned and the professor drawing
the remaining lucky slips. This would leave Tod,
Mr. Bell and Bob to defend the airship. The
professor was delighted at his success.</p>

<p>“Now I will get the flying lizard!” he cried.</p>

<p>Toward dusk Mr. Deering came back. He
seemed ten years younger since hearing the good
news, and reported that his friends were eager
for the time to come for the rescue.</p>

<p>“I have brought some disguises that you may
want to wear, in case any of you plan to come to
the Indian village,” said the aged man, producing
a bundle which contained suits of very thin skins.
“The Indians use these in some of their dances,”
he went on, “and there are face masks, false
beards and wigs which will change you from
whites into redmen very quickly. I have four
suits, which I took from the temple.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” cried Jerry. “We will put
them on when we go to rescue your friends. I
was wondering how we could approach unobserved.”
The details of the escape were then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
told to Mr. Deering, and he was instructed to
have his friends in waiting at a point he designated
near the temple. At the proper time they would
be led to the airship, as it was considered best not
to have them attempt to reach it unaccompanied
by some of the rescuers.</p>

<p>“I’ll not come out here again,” said the aged
prisoner, “for some of the Indians are already
suspicious. We will expect you to-morrow night,
when the feast is at its height.”</p>

<p>It seemed to the adventurers in the airship that
the next night would never come, but it did at last,
and was ushered in with a rain storm.</p>

<p>“Bur-r-r-r! We’re going to get wet!” complained
Ned, as the four were about to set out.</p>

<p>“Don’t kick,” advised Jerry. “It will be all
the better for us. The rain will make the feast
fires burn dimly.”</p>

<p>“And the flying lizards won’t be able to fly so
well,” added the professor, as if the whole expedition
was for that object alone.</p>

<p>Sledge Hammer Tod was made a sort of captain
of the slender forces left to guard the airship,
and he got out the guns and revolvers, of which
there were quite a collection, and in which task
he was aided by Bob.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>MYSTERIOUS RITES</small></h2>


<p>The rain seemed to come down harder than
ever when the four members of the rescue party
started to make their way along the strange valley.
Mr. Deering had told them the route to
follow, or they might have become confused in
the storm and darkness.</p>

<p>“Have you got your revolvers handy, Jerry,
and Ned?” asked Jim Nestor, as they trudged
along.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the tall lad, “but I hope there
will be no occasion to use them.”</p>

<p>On they hurried, the rain coming down harder
than ever. But the Indian disguises of animal
skins served a good purpose, for they were waterproof.</p>

<p>As they turned around a bend in the trail they
came in full view of the Indian encampment, or,
rather village, for it was a permanent town, with
log huts arranged neatly in rows, or streets. In
the centre of a sort of public square could be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a large building. This was evidently the place
where the ceremonies were to take place, for it
was lighted up, and outside it, in spite of the rain,
several fires blazed. It was evident that some sort
of oil or grease kept them from going out.</p>

<p>Proceeding on a little farther, the four rescuers
found themselves in the very midst of the
village. Now indeed were they in danger for,
from the houses on every side, came Indians&mdash;men,
women and children there were&mdash;all hurrying
toward the temple, or council house. And
every one was in disguise. Some were attired as
birds and some as beasts, while a few elected to
represent serpents, and crawled along on all fours.
It was well that Mr. Deering had thought to provide
the four suits of skins for our friends, or they
would hardly have been able to penetrate into the
very heart of the savage town without being detected.</p>

<p>“There’s the medicine men’s hut,” whispered
Jerry to Jim as they came closer to the temple,
and saw near it, a smaller cabin. At that moment
the four rescuers were comparatively alone,
and it was safe to make this remark. The miner
nodded, and the next moment our friends found
themselves the centre of a throng that was hurrying
into the big council house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The four had planned to stay near the outer
doors, as they wanted to be where they could get
out quickly when the time came. This would be
when the mysterious rites were at their height,
and would be at the point when the old flying
lizard was taken away and a new one, to remain
in place for the coming year, was substituted.</p>

<p>The interior of the temple presented a wonderful
sight, and, had Jerry and Ned and the others
not been nervous over the parts they were playing,
they would have found much to marvel over, and
admire. The walls were hung with the skins of
wild animals, mingled with the feathers of birds,
dyed various brilliant hues.</p>

<p>At one end of the building, which seemed to
consist mainly of one big room, was a raised platform,
and on this were many Indians, evidently the
medicine men. They were attired in all sorts of
horrid and weird costumes, some representing animals,
and some combinations of men and beasts.
There was a sort of altar, and on this there was
a large round stone, that glittered like gold. The
attention of everyone seemed focused on this
stone.</p>

<p>The temple was now almost filled with the
Indians, who crowded every available place, and
yet others kept coming to see and to hear what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
was going on. Our friends kept near a doorway,
and watched everything narrowly.</p>

<p>Though they were in some fear lest they be
discovered, in which case their lives would instantly
have paid the forfeit, they need not have been
alarmed&mdash;at least just then. They looked too
much like all the Indians around them, and, besides,
every savage was too intent on the ceremonies
about to take place to glance at his neighbors.</p>

<p>The four rescuers had not been in the place
more than ten minutes before the weird rites
began. The medicine men first started a monotonous
chant, keeping time as they marched around
the altar containing the golden stone. Their
voices rose above the patter of the rain on the
roof, and filled the great structure. The place
was lighted by torches, and fires burning along
the sides, while occasionally, through the opened
windows, could be seen the gleams of the signal
blazes, reflected from the polished stones. These
were to call in any wandering parties of savages.</p>

<p>Suddenly the chant ceased, and all the Indians
bowed down. Jerry and his friends did the same.
When they rose they saw that the medicine men
stood in a half circle about the altar. One Indian,
evidently the leader, began a strange, high-pitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
song, and, at the close, he rushed to the golden
stone, and struck it a blow with a stick he carried.
Instantly the stone opened and from the interior
the medicine man drew out a curious object.</p>

<p>By the start of the professor, whose eyes lighted
on it, Jerry and the others knew what it was&mdash;the
flying lizard. High up over his head the medicine
man held the odd creature, a crawling reptile,
about a foot long, which, as it was elevated, spread
out four green wings. It was a strange and fearsome
creature, but the professor fairly trembled
with eagerness as he beheld it.</p>

<p>After holding it in the air a moment the chief
medicine man cried out what was evidently a
question. It was answered by a shout from all
the people. Then he made a motion as if about
to kill the flying lizard, but, instead, handed it to
one of the medicine men surrounding him. The
Indian, carrying the reptile, started to leave the
temple. At the same time, from some source
which the rescuers could not detect, another flying
lizard was produced. It was held up as the first
had been. Again came the question from the chief
medicine man, and again the answer, in a shouted
chorus. This was evidently the new lizard, for it
was placed inside the gold stone, which was closed
up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the medicine men took up their chant once
more, and began to march around the altar, while
the whole concourse of people, in their strange costumes,
prostrated themselves flat on their faces
on the floor of the temple.</p>

<p>“Now’s our chance!” whispered Nestor to the
others. “We can slip out now, and none of them
will see us. We’ll go to the hut, get the eight
prisoners and escape! The feasting will begin
in a little while, and the Indians will be too interested
to notice anything.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Jerry in a whisper. They
turned quickly, and left the temple. The people
were still on their faces. The Indian who had
been given the old lizard to dispose of was seen
hurrying back up the middle aisle. Evidently he
wanted to join in the rites.</p>

<p>“Oh, where did he put that beautiful specimen?”
murmured the professor. “I must have
it!”</p>

<p>“No time for that now,” answered Jim.</p>

<p>They were out of the temple by this time, and
hurrying toward the medicine men’s hut. As they
ran on, the professor in the rear, and with Ned,
Jerry and Jim Nestor, grasping, under their skin
disguises, their revolvers, the scientist suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
uttered a low cry. Jerry turned, and saw something
green glittering on the ground.</p>

<p>“The lizard! The flying lizard!” exclaimed
Mr. Snodgrass in a hoarse whisper. “The Indian
did not kill it, after all. I have you, oh, my
beauty!”</p>

<p>He stooped, caught up the nasty looking creature,
and quickly put it in his green specimen box.
Then he hastened on with the others toward the
hut. From inside the temple came a weird chant.</p>

<p>“Now for the rescue!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>They reached the hut, which was in a shadow.
As they were at the entrance, there emerged from
it eight figures.</p>

<p>“We are here,” spoke Mr. Deering. “Is
everything all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jerry. “Come with us now,
we will save you.”</p>

<p>There was no reply from the others, but Ned
thought he heard a woman sobbing. It was a
long hope realized. The prisoners had been rescued,
but they had yet to be taken from the deep
valley and away from their savage captors.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>THE FIGHT</small></h2>


<p>Silently the little band&mdash;the rescuers and the
rescued ones&mdash;filed past the temple. They had to
cross in front of it to take the path which led to
where the airship was anchored, but they thought
there would be little danger, on account of the
important ceremonies going on.</p>

<p>“You take the lead, Jerry,” advised Jim Nestor
in a low voice. “I’ll guard the rear. Have your
guns handy. No telling what may happen, but it
looks as if we were going to make a quiet getaway.”</p>

<p>Alas for their hopes! They were at the temple
entrance now, when there suddenly emerged one
of the medicine men. He was the same one who
had been given the lizard to destroy.</p>

<p>For a moment the Indian, after reaching the
door, stared about him. He was evidently searching
for the reptile he had carelessly laid down.
Possibly he had been reproved for his hasty action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in throwing the reptile away, and been sent
back to finish the work. But the flying lizard was
not to be seen, and good reason, for, at that moment
it was in the professor’s green box.</p>

<p>The medicine man, not seeing it, stepped from
the threshold of the council house. His eyes
roved over the ground, that was illuminated by
distant blazes, which were brighter, now that
the rain had somewhat ceased. Then the Indian
looked up, and caught sight of the figures moving
past the temple. At first he must have taken
them for some of his fellows, but at that moment
the lizard which the professor had placed alive in
his specimen box, uttered a sort of curious squeak.
There was no mistaking it, and the medicine man’s
sharp ears told him from whence the sound came.
He must have suspected something, for, though
the captives, like the rescuers, were dressed in
skin disguises, the Indian sprang at them, and
caught hold of one&mdash;a woman.</p>

<p>Instantly there was confusion. The Indian set
up a yell which at once stopped the weird chant
inside the temple. Then the lone medicine man
began to drag the escaping woman toward the
big building. Jerry and Ned drew their revolvers.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to fight!” exclaimed the tall lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian was dragging the woman from the
restraining grasp of her companions. Jim Nestor
stepped up to him.</p>

<p>“That will be about all from you!” exclaimed
the miner. His fist shot out, and the Indian
dropped like a log. Nor did he shout any longer.
He had been knocked unconscious. “That’s better
than using a gun,” explained Nestor. “Now
scoot for it&mdash;everybody!”</p>

<p>They needed no urging. The pursuit would
begin any moment. Already several of the Indians
were running from the temple in response
to the call from the medicine man, and the ceremonies
had evidently been brought to an abrupt
end.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jerry. “I only hope we can
stand them off until we reach the airship. Are
all your friends here, Mr. Deering?”</p>

<p>“All that are left of us,” was the sad reply.</p>

<p>The captives and their rescuers hastened on.
By good luck they were now beyond the gleams
cast by the nearest fires and the crowd of Indians
that poured from the temple could not at first
discover the reason for the imperative summons
given by their medicine man. But they soon
learned the cause, for the prostrate one, recovering
from Nestor’s blow, excitedly told what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
happened, that their prisoners were escaping.
There was a rush of feet and voices called one to
the other. Then came a gleam as of torches being
torn from their places in the temple.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” exclaimed Ned, grimly.</p>

<p>“Do the best you can,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>The three women of the party were placed in
the middle, with the men grouped around them.
Jerry and Ned were in the lead, while Nestor,
with Professor Snodgrass, and one of the younger
men of the prisoners, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a hissing sound in the air,
and something seemed to fly over the heads of
the escaping ones.</p>

<p>“Arrows!” exclaimed Mr. Deering. “They are
shooting arrows at us. Few of the Indians have
guns, but those few may use them.”</p>

<p>His fear proved correct a little later, when
the darkness of the night was cut by slivers of
flame, and bullets sang over the heads of our
friends, and those they were trying to save.</p>

<p>“If they don’t shoot any better than that we
have little to fear,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Ned, ducking as something
sang over his head. “That was closer. I’m going
to fire, Jerry!”</p>

<p>As he spoke he leveled his revolver at the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
mass of pursuing Indians, and fired. Jerry did
the same. It was the only thing to do to save
their lives and protect the prisoners. Jim Nestor
now opened fire, and the professor, anxious to
protect the flying lizard he had so unexpectedly
secured, plucked up courage to use the extra revolver,
which the miner had thrust into his hand.
Jerry, Ned and Nestor each had two, fully loaded.</p>

<p>The fight was now on in earnest, the Indians
battling desperately, for they wanted to keep their
prisoners, punish those who had dared interrupt
the sacred rites, and they wanted to secure the
flying lizard. With howls and yells they came on,
now sending a flight of arrows and again using
their guns. Fortunately none of our friends were
hurt, but occasional cries of pain from the Indians
told that some had been struck. The battle went
on in the rain and darkness, the four rescuers
seeking to get the prisoners to the airship. On
they rushed, firing and being fired upon. The
ceremonial lights were less frequent now, and
the fugitives were better protected by darkness.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we near the airship?” panted the professor,
as he fired the last shot in his revolver.
None of the bullets could have found a mark, as
he aimed the weapon high in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re almost there,” answered Jerry. “Are
they coming any nearer, Jim?”</p>

<p>“They’re pressing us close,” replied the miner.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the little band, running for their
lives, turned a huge rock in the path toward the
upper end of the valley where the airship was,
they saw coming toward them several persons. In
the darkness Jerry took them for a party of
Indians that had gotten ahead of them to cut off
their escape. He was about to fire, when a voice
called out:</p>

<p>“Are you there?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes, Chunky!” cried the tall lad. “But
why did you leave the ship?”</p>

<p>“To come to your rescue,” answered Bob. “We
heard the firing, and couldn’t stand it any longer!”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>NODDY NIXON DEFEATED&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>Jerry felt a sensation of relief. Help had appeared
at a most-needed time. An instant after
he had spoken Bob raised his rifle and began to
pump bullets into the mass of Indians. His example
was followed by Sledge Hammer Tod and
Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>Such an unexpected fire threw the savages into
a panic. They fell back, their leaders crying in
vain to make the warriors keep to the attack.</p>

<p>“Now’s our chance!” cried Jerry, looking back,
and seeing the confusion in the ranks of their
enemies. “The airship is just ahead!”</p>

<p>With a final rush they gained it. The old men
and women were helped into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Cast off!” cried Jerry to Ned and Bob, who
were on the alert for orders. The tall lad rushed
to the pilot house and started the gas machine.
The <i>Comet</i> was tugging and straining at the holding
ropes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll stand off the savages, Tod and I!”
yelled Nestor. “You move the ship, Jerry!”</p>

<p>There was need of defense, for the savages had
again rushed forward, and now surrounded the
airship. They could be plainly seen, as the scores
of electric lamps in the craft had been turned on.
The two miners began a fusillade against their
enemies, Mr. Bell and the professor joining in.</p>

<p>The gas was rushing into the big bag, and, in
a few minutes it was sufficiently filled. Jerry
started the big propellers, and with a rush the airship
left the valleys, soaring upward toward the
clouds.</p>

<p>“We’re safe!” cried Jerry a little later, when
he noted that the airship was a thousand feet
high. “Now which way shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere, so long as it is away from this
valley,” replied Mr. Deering.</p>

<p>Jerry headed the craft back over the route
they had come, and then, setting the automatic
steering apparatus, he and the others gave their
attention to the captives. Fortunately none of
them was hurt, though all were well-nigh exhausted
by the race for life. Hot coffee which Bob,
true to his promise, had ready, revived them.
Then the comparatively slight injuries the rescuers
had received were attended to, and they exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
experiences. Bob, and the others in the
airship, had been waiting and listening, and, hearing
firing, had rushed out in the nick of time.</p>

<p>The rescuers divested themselves of their disguises,
which were saved as souvenirs of the
trip.</p>

<p>When matters had somewhat quieted down,
Mr. Deering and several of the men prisoners
came forward with sacks that seemed quite heavy.
They laid them on the cabin table.</p>

<p>“What are these?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The gold nuggets,” was the answer. “We
held on to them during our flight. Now they are
yours.”</p>

<p>But Jerry and his chums and friends would not
take the gold. They insisted that the men and
women who had been saved would need the
money to provide the necessaries of life, now that
they were to go back to civilization.</p>

<p>This brought up the subject of what was to be
their future, and, though Mr. Bell offered to
provide for the refugees, they decided they would
all rather go to some small town, and there begin
life over again.</p>

<p>“Then Rockyford is just the place for you,”
suggested Jim Nestor. “You can live there, as
well as anywhere else, it’s not far from here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
close to the diggings, so I can sort of keep an
eye on you, in case these Indians try to recapture
you,” and he chuckled at the idea of the severely
punished redmen daring to venture out of their
valley. “Tod and I will soon be back at the
mine,” went on Nestor.</p>

<p>“That is, if Noddy Nixon hasn’t gotten possession,”
remarked Jerry. “I’ve been apprehensive
ever since we came away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get the best of him yet,” ventured
Bob.</p>

<p>After Mr. Deering and his companions had
talked the matter over among themselves, they
decided to adopt the advice of Jim Nestor, and
make their homes in Rockyford. Professor Snodgrass
wanted his cousin to come East with him,
and aid science in searching for rare bugs.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Mr. Deering. “I’ve
seen all I want to of bugs and flying lizards, since
I’ve been among the Indians. I wouldn’t even
catch a fly now, science or no science.”</p>

<p>The professor sighed, but made no further
suggestions. The refugees and their rescuers
traveled all that night in the airship, and, though
the boys managed to get some sleep, when they
were not on watch, the recent captives found so
many novelties to take their attention, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
so fraught with wonder at the idea of sailing
through the air, that they did not slumber much.</p>

<p>Three days later, flying under fair skies, and
before favorable winds, the travelers of the air
sighted the mountains that marked the location of
Rockyford, and the boys’ gold mine.</p>

<p>“We’ll be there in about an hour,” announced
Jerry, but he did not reckon on an accident that
happened about ten minutes later. One of the
auxiliary planes of the motor ship broke, and it
was decided to descend to repair it. The work
did not take long, however, and, while it was
going on, Mr. Deering and his friends left the
ship, and strolled across the grassy plain, for
they were tired of their rather cramped quarters.
Professor Snodgrass, naturally, could not miss a
chance like that, to hunt for specimens, and he
was soon making a careful examination of the
ground, and every tree and shrub that he approached.
He caught several bugs and insects,
all of which were very valuable, he said, but the
boys were too anxious to get on to their mine,
and see what was the outcome of the claim Noddy
had made, to pay much attention to the scientist.</p>

<p>At last the repairs were completed, the party
re-entered the ship, Professor Snodgrass, as usual,
being last, and then the journey was resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurrah! There’s Mike Malone on guard!”
cried Ned, when, after coming within sight of
the mine, he had peered through a telescope.</p>

<p>“Is he?” cried Bob. “Then, if he’s in possession,
the lawsuit isn’t settled yet. There is some
doubt about it, and we have a chance to hold our
mine.”</p>

<p>“Unless Mr. Malone is there in the interests
of Noddy and his gang,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not much!” exclaimed Jim Nestor. “You
couldn’t hire Mike to work for that bully. You’ll
find that the case isn’t settled yet.”</p>

<p>By this time they were within sight of the
deputy sheriff, who had sprung to his feet, when
he first had a glimpse of the airship, and was
now wildly swinging his hat.</p>

<p>A safe landing was made, and, even before
they had seen to the disembarkation of their
refugee passengers, Jerry, Ned and Bob made a
rush for the deputy, who was broadly smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, how about it?” panted Jerry.</p>

<p>“How about what?” inquired Malone, with
provoking slowness.</p>

<p>“The mine&mdash;our mine&mdash;is it still ours?” spluttered
Bob.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” was the hearty response of the
deputy sheriff. “Noddy Nixon and his gang have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
been cleaned out, bag and baggage, by the Supreme
Court. Their case came up day before
yesterday, and their lawyer made a big talk.
They went on the stand&mdash;Noddy and some of his
cronies did&mdash;but shucks! what they said didn’t
amount to a hill of beans. Then the lawyer you
folks had hired made a little talk, and it was all
over but the shoutin’. The court said Noddy
had no claim and decided in your favor, and instructed
me to remain in possession until you
came, and then to turn the mine over to you.</p>

<p>“Which,” went on Malone, “I do, to wit, in
manner following, that is to say, accordin’ to the
statutes in such cases made an’ provided, all in
due formality with the laws of the United States
in general and Arizona in particular, an’ blamed
glad I am to get rid of this job, only you needn’t
tell the judge I said so,” and, with an air of relief,
the official turned over to Jim Nestor papers
confirming the right of the boys and their friends
to the gold mine.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! That’s the stuff!” cried Bob, throwing
his hat up in the air, and trying to catch it,
but failing, and stumbling down in a heap over
a pile of slag.</p>

<p>“Did Noddy make any fuss?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“He tried to,” was the grim answer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
deputy. “He come out here, and tried to sass
me, but I ordered him off.”</p>

<p>“Did he go?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he did,” was the quick reply.
“He and those fellows with him. Noddy allowed
as how he was going to get even with you chaps,
though, sometime or other.”</p>

<p>“Let him try,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>Noddy did try, and with what results, and
what befell the motor boys in another trip they
made in their airship, will be told of in the next
volume of this series, to be called “The Motor
Boys Over the Ocean; Or, A Marvelous Rescue
in Mid-Air.”</p>

<p>After a short rest at the mine, and when the
last of the legal formalities regarding the mine
had been complied with, the <i>Comet</i> was again
put in motion, sent up into the air, and the trip
to Rockyford made.</p>

<p>There the refugees were made comfortable in
a hotel, until they could obtain permanent homes.
This they soon did, as the nuggets they had managed
to bring away with them proved to be very
valuable.</p>

<p>As for our heroes, they found that the new
gold vein that was discovered in their mine, was
richer even than Jim Nestor and his miners had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
dared to hope. For a time there was some apprehension
lest Noddy Nixon and his cronies return
to do some mischief, but they seemed to have
left that part of the country. Professor Snodgrass
captured many more specimens, but none
that gave him as much pleasure as did the flying
lizard, which he mounted in a life-like attitude.</p>

<p>Nothing more was ever heard of the Indians
of Lost Valley, for no one cared to make a trip
to that perilous place, and it was thought that the
savages were severely punished in the battle
against the whites. Mr. Bell soon located his
son, and had a thrilling story to tell him of the
search and rescue.</p>

<p>The motor boys returned East, after a month
spent in the vicinity of their mine, during which
time they made frequent trips in the <i>Comet</i>.
They were well satisfied with their trip across
the Rockies, but were fully determined to seek
other adventures in the near future, and it may
be said that they had little difficulty in finding
them.</p>
